It can be used\\nwith MS-DOS and Windows operating systems and works with many applications\\nproducts from Microsoft and other companies.  The mouse for the Intel\\nmicroprocessor-based PC was first introduced in 1983.  The mouse is sold\\nseparately or with Microsoft Windows.\\n\\nIn 1991, the Company began marketing the Microsoft BallPoint(R) Mouse, designed\\nespecially for use with laptop and notebook computers.  The BallPoint Mouse is\\nshipped with a universal clamp that fits on the keyboards of most laptop\\ncomputers and a positioner that allows the user to adjust the angle of the\\nmouse to the keyboard.  In August 1994, the Company began shipping the\\nMicrosoft Natural Keyboard, an ergonomically superior keyboard input device.\\n\\n\\n                                                                 MICROSOFT PRESS\\n\\nFounded in 1983, Microsoft Press publishes books about software products from\\nMicrosoft and other software developers and about current developments in the\\nindustry.  Books published by Microsoft Press typically are written and\\ncopyrighted by independent authors who submit their manuscripts to the Company\\nfor publication and who receive royalties based on net revenues generated by\\nthe product.\\n\\nMicrosoft Press contracts with an independent commercial printer for the\\nmanufacturing of its books.  Publisher\\'s Resources, Inc. acts as the Company\\'s\\nmain fulfillment house in the United States, maintaining the majority of the\\ninventory of Microsoft Press books.  Books are marketed by independent sales\\nrepresentatives and by Microsoft Press sales personnel.  Internationally,\\nMicrosoft Press has numerous international agreements with publishers for the\\nworldwide distribution of its books.  Microsoft Press has granted a publisher\\nin England the right to distribute English language versions of its books in\\nall countries except the United States, Canada, Central and South America, and\\ncertain Asian countries.

Thus, in France, for\\nexample, all user messages and documentation are in French and all monetary\\nreferences are in French francs, and in the United Kingdom, monetary references\\nare in pounds and user messages and documentation reflect certain British\\nconventions.  Various Microsoft products have been localized into more than 30\\nlanguages.\\n\\nMARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION\\n\\nMicrosoft aligns its sales and marketing people with three customer types: end\\nusers, organizations, and OEMs.  The Company\\'s sales and marketing staff builds\\nlong-term relationships with these customers of Microsoft products.  Microsoft\\nhas four major channels of distribution which deliver product to end users:\\nfinished goods in the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and Other International; and\\nOEM.\\n\\nThe end user customer unit has responsibility for activities that target end\\nusers who make individual buying decisions for the PCs they use at work or\\nhome.  As such, the end user unit handles distributor and reseller\\nrelationships; reseller sales terms and conditions; channel marketing and\\npromotions; end user marketing programs; support policies; and seminars,\\nevents, and sales training for resellers.  Key products are the Company\\'s\\npersonal operating systems and consumer and desktop applications.\\n\\nThe organization customer unit has responsibility for activities that target\\ngroups of users in large, medium, and small organizations.  The unit works with\\nSolutions Providers, the Microsoft Consulting Services division, and directly\\nwith organizations to create enterprise-wide solutions to business computing\\nproblems.  The unit handles computing strategy for organizations; consulting\\nstrategy for organizations and Solutions Providers; vertical marketing\\nprograms; and large account licensing programs.  Additionally, the unit is\\nresponsible for the technical training of Solutions Providers and channel\\nresellers; support policies; and seminars, events, and sales training for\\nresellers and Solutions Providers.  Key products are the Company\\'s business\\nsystems, developer software, and software licensed via large corporate account\\nprograms.\\n\\nThe OEM customer unit includes the sales force which works with original\\nequipment manufacturers who include Microsoft software on their PCs.\\n\\nFINISHED GOODS CHANNELS\\n\\nDISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS:  The Company markets its products in the finished\\ngoods channels primarily through independent, non-exclusive distributors and\\nresellers.  Distributors include Computer 2000, Ingram Micro, and Merisel.\\nResellers include Corporate Software, Egghead Software, Softmart, and Software\\nSpectrum.  Microsoft has a network of field sales representatives and field\\nsupport personnel who solicit orders from distributors and resellers and\\nprovide product training and sales support.\\n\\nLARGE ACCOUNTS:  The Company has a program designed to make it easier for large\\norganizations to acquire and maintain Microsoft products.  The program,\\nMicrosoft Select, offers flexible software acquisition, licensing, and\\nmaintenance options specially designed to meet the needs of large multinational\\norganizations.

Programs are typically directed\\nthrough the mail, utilizing lists of targeted individuals.  The Company uses\\ndirect marketing to promote sales of new versions of products to existing\\nusers.  Fulfillment of product to the end user is accomplished by either direct\\nshipment or through resellers.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL SALES SITES:  The Company has established marketing, support,\\nand/or distribution subsidiaries in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,\\nBrazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Dubai, Ecuador,\\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel,\\nItaly, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\\nPeople\\'s Republic of China, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia,\\nSingapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan,\\nThailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s international operations, both OEM and finished goods, are\\nsubject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general, such as\\ngovernmental regulations, import restrictions, and foreign exchange rate\\nfluctuations.  Information with respect to international operations and export\\nsales may be found on page 17 of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, which\\nis incorporated herein by reference.\\n\\nOEM CHANNEL\\n\\nThe Company\\'s operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements\\nthat grant the OEMs the right to distribute copies of Microsoft\\'s products with\\nthe OEMs\\' microcomputers. The Company also markets certain language and\\napplications programs to OEMs under similar arrangements.  In addition, the\\nCompany markets the Microsoft Mouse and BallPoint Mouse to OEMs for\\ndistribution to buyers of the OEMs\\' computers.  In almost all cases, the\\nproducts are distributed under Microsoft trademarks.  The Company has OEM\\nagreements covering one or more of its products with virtually all of the major\\nmicrocomputer OEMs, including AST Research, DEC, Dell, Compaq, Fujitsu, Gateway\\n2000, IBM, NEC, Olivetti, Packard Bell, Toshiba, Unisys, and Zenith.\\n\\nADVERTISING\\n\\nThe Company works closely with large advertising and direct marketing firms.\\nAdvertising, direct marketing, worldwide packaging, and marketing materials are\\ntargeted to various end-user segments.  The Company utilizes broad consumer\\nmedium (television, radio, and business publications) and trade publications.\\nMicrosoft also invests heavily in direct marketing and customer satisfaction\\nareas.  In 1995, the Company plans to spend more than $100 million on a broad\\ncampaign emphasizing Microsoft brand identity.\\n\\nPRODUCT SUPPORT\\n\\nThe Company\\'s Product Support Services group, with locations in the\\nU.S. and in Microsoft subsidiaries, provides product support coverage options\\nto meet the needs of users of Microsoft products.  The Company hires\\nindividuals with proven product expertise and provides them with productivity\\ntools, continuous product education and training, and consistent processes to\\ndeliver quality support for Microsoft products.  Coverage options range from\\nstandard no-charge toll telephone support to fee-based offerings providing\\nunlimited 800# telephone and electronic technical support across all Microsoft\\nproducts 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\\n\\nUsers have access to Microsoft KnowledgeBase, a repository of over\\n55,000 technical articles that is updated regularly with useful information\\nregarding Microsoft products.  Microsoft provides access to KnowledgeBase via\\nCompuServe(R), GEnie(TM), Prodigy, America Online, and Internet.  Additionally,\\nthe Company offers two information subscription services: Microsoft TechNet and\\nMicrosoft Developer Network.\\n\\nAs a supplement or alternative to direct support, the Company enhances the\\nthird party support channel by providing Microsoft Solutions Providers with\\neducation, training, tools, and support.  Microsoft Solutions Providers\\ninclude Authorized Training Centers, which offer advanced product education and\\ncertification on Microsoft products; and Authorized Support Centers, which\\nprovide a wide spectrum of multinational support, multivendor support, and\\nintegration services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       7\\n<PAGE>   10\\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nAs described above, Microsoft has three customer types: end users,\\norganizations, and OEMs.  The Company believes that most of the end users of\\nits products are individuals in businesses, government agencies, educational\\ninstitutions, and at home.  These end users obtain Microsoft products primarily\\nthrough distributors, resellers, and OEMs, which include certain Microsoft\\nproducts with their hardware.  Notes to Financial Statements on page 13 of the\\n1994 Annual Report to Shareholders describe customers that represent more than\\n10% of the Company\\'s revenues.  The Company\\'s practice is to ship its products\\npromptly upon receipt of purchase orders from its customers and, consequently,\\nbacklog is not significant.\\n\\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nThe microcomputer software industry is characterized by rapid technological\\nchange, which requires a continuous high level of expenditures for enhancing\\nexisting products and developing new products.  The Company is committed to\\ncontinued expenditures for research and product development.\\n\\nMost of the Company\\'s software products are developed internally.  The Company\\nalso purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and oversees\\nthird party development for certain products.  Product documentation is also\\ncreated internally.  Internal development enables Microsoft to maintain closer\\ntechnical control over the products and gives the Company the freedom to\\ndesignate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they\\nshould be implemented.  The Company has created a substantial body of\\nproprietary development tools and has evolved a development methodology for\\ncreating and enhancing its products.  These tools and methodology are also\\ndesigned to simplify a product\\'s portability among different operating systems\\nor computers.\\n\\nThe Company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is\\ngetting it to market quickly to respond to a new user need or an advance in\\nhardware design, without compromising product quality.  The Company strives to\\nbecome as informed as possible at the earliest possible time about\\ntechnological advances and changing usage patterns.\\n\\nDuring fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994, the Company spent $352 million, $470\\nmillion, and $610 million, respectively, on product research and development\\nactivities.  Those amounts represented 12.8%, 12.5%, and 13.1%, respectively,\\nof net revenues in each of those years.\\n\\nCOMPETITION\\n\\nThe microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and subject to rapid\\nchange.  The Company\\'s competitors include many independent software vendors,\\nsuch as Lotus Development, Oracle, and Novell.  These companies generally have\\na narrower focus than the Company in product offerings such as spreadsheets,\\nrelational databases, word processors, and networking software.\\n\\nLarge personal computer OEMs are devoting significant resources to creating\\noperating systems, notably IBM, Apple Computer, and Sun Microsystems.\\nMicrosoft markets its operating systems products to OEMs and end users.  The\\nCompany competes for that business with the large OEMs and joint ventures of\\nOEMs, and independent systems software vendors, such as Novell.\\n\\nThe Company believes that the principal competitive factors in marketing\\nmicrocomputer software are the product\\'s reputation, features and functions,\\nease of use, reliability, price relative to performance, timeliness of\\ndelivery, and availability and quality of support services.  There is no\\nassurance that the Company\\'s competitive position will not be adversely\\naffected by one or more of these factors in the future.\\n\\nSee \"Outlook: Issues and Risks\" on page 6 of the 1994 Annual Report to\\nShareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       8\\n<PAGE>   11\\n\\nPRODUCT PROTECTION\\n\\nMicrosoft regards the intellectual property used in its software as proprietary\\nand attempts to protect it with copyrights, patents, trade secret laws,\\ninternal and external nondisclosure safeguards, and restrictions on disclosure\\nand transfer that are incorporated into its software license agreements.\\nDespite these restrictions, it is possible for competitors and users to copy\\naspects of the Company\\'s products or to obtain and use information that the\\nCompany regards as proprietary. Existing laws protecting intellectual property\\nare helpful but imperfect aids in preventing unauthorized copying and use of\\nthe Company\\'s products.  Monitoring and identifying unauthorized copying and\\nuse of software can be difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem\\nfor the software industry.  Piracy is  particularly acute in international\\nmarkets.  Some of the Company\\'s products distributed internationally use\\nelectronic copy protection to assist in preventing unauthorized copies, but the\\nmore typical Company antipiracy strategy is to work with others in the industry\\nto secure the passage of appropriate laws protecting software, to educate the\\nmarket and persuade users about the benefits of legitimate software, and to\\nparticipate in selective enforcement actions.\\n\\nMANUFACTURING\\n\\nThe Company has manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Puerto\\nRico, and Ireland.  The Company\\'s manufacturing operations involve the\\nduplication of disks, assembly of purchased parts, and final packaging.\\nQuality control tests are performed on purchased parts, duplicated disks, and\\nfinished products.  The chief materials and components used in Microsoft\\nproducts include disks, books, and multicolor printed materials.  The Company\\nis often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount\\nbasis.  The Company has multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and\\ncomponents.\\n\\nThe Company contracts a portion of its manufacturing activity to third parties.\\nOutside manufacturers produce software products, documentation, and hardware\\nsuch as mouse pointing devices.  There are other custom manufacturers in the\\nevent that products become unavailable from current sources.\\n\\nEMPLOYEES\\n\\nAs of June 30, 1994, the Company employed 15,257 people, 10,264 domestically\\nand 4,993 internationally.  Of the total, 4,417 were in product research and\\ndevelopment, 8,079 in sales, marketing, and support, 1,344 in manufacturing and\\ndistribution, and 1,417 in finance and administration.  Microsoft\\'s success is\\nhighly dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\\nCompetition for employees is intense in the software industry.  To date, the\\nCompany believes it has been successful in its efforts to recruit qualified\\nemployees, but there is no assurance that it will continue to be as successful\\nin the future.  None of the Company\\'s employees are subject to collective\\nbargaining agreements.  The Company believes that relations with its employees\\nare excellent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       9\\n<PAGE>   12\\n\\nItem 2.

The Company owns all of its corporate\\ncampus.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s domestic manufacturing and distribution operation consists of a\\n265,000 square foot facility situated on 23 acres in nearby Snohomish County,\\nWashington, and a 45,000 square foot disk duplication facility in Humacao,\\nPuerto Rico.  The Puerto Rican facility, which began operation in April 1990,\\nis leased under a 10-year lease, with an option to renew for an additional 10\\nyears.  The Company\\'s European manufacturing operation consists of a 155,000\\nsquare foot facility situated on 12 acres in Dublin, Ireland.  The Ireland site\\nalso includes a 25,000 square foot office building for international\\nlocalization.\\n\\nThe Company owns a 65,000 square foot office building on seven acres of land\\nnear London, England.  In Les Ulis, France, the Company owns a 110,000 square\\nfoot office building on four acres of land.\\n\\nIn addition, the Company leases office space in numerous locations in the\\nUnited States and many other countries.\\n\\nItem 3.

Neither (1) the failure of the\\n         Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its shareholders, or\\n         independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the\\n         commencement of such proceeding that indemnification or reimbursement\\n         or advancement of Expenses to the Indemnitee is proper in the\\n         circumstances; nor (2) an actual determination by the Corporation\\n         (including its Board of Directors, its shareholders, or independent\\n         legal counsel that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification\\n         or to the reimbursement or advancement of Expenses, shall be a defense\\n         to the proceeding or create a presumption that the Indemnitee is not\\n         so entitled.\\n\\n                 12.6.5   NONEXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS.  The right to\\n         indemnification and the payment of Expenses incurred in defending a\\n         Proceeding in advance of its final disposition granted in this Article\\n         shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnitee may\\n         have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Article\\n         or the Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested\\n         directors, or otherwise.  The Corporation shall have the express right\\n         to grant additional indemnity without seeking further approval or\\n         satisfaction by the shareholders.  All applicable indemnity provisions\\n         and any applicable law shall be interpreted and applied so as to\\n         provide an Indemnitee with the broadest but nonduplicative indemnity\\n         to which he or she is entitled.\\n\\n         12.7    Contribution.  If the indemnification provided in Section 12.2\\nof this Article is not available to be paid to Indemnitee for any reason other\\nthan those set forth in subparagraphs 12.2(a), 12.2(b), and 12.2(c) of Section\\n12.2 of this Article (for example, because indemnification is held to be\\nagainst public policy even though otherwise permitted under Section 12.2) then\\nin respect of any proceeding in which the Corporation is jointly liable with\\nIndemnitee (or would be if joined in such proceeding), the Corporation shall\\ncontribute to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in such\\nproportion as is appropriate to reflect:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      -9-\\n<PAGE>   10\\n\\n                          The relative benefits received by the Corporation on\\n                          the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand\\n                          from the transaction from which such proceeding\\n                          arose, and\\n\\n                          The relative fault of the Corporation on the one hand\\n                          and the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection\\n                          with the events which resulted in such loss, as well\\n                          as any other relevant equitable consideration.\\n\\n         The relative benefits received by and fault of the Corporation on the\\none hand and the Indemnitee on the other shall be determined by a court of\\nappropriate jurisdiction (which may be the same court in which the proceeding\\ntook place) with reference to, among other things, the parties\\' relative\\nintent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent\\nthe circumstances resulting in such loss.  The Corporation agrees that it would\\nnot be just and equitable if a contribution pursuant to this Article was\\ndetermined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does\\nnot take account of the foregoing equitable considerations.\\n\\n         12.8    Exceptions. Any other provision herein to the contrary\\nnotwithstanding, the Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms\\nof these Articles to indemnify or advance Expenses to Indemnitee with respect\\nto any proceeding.\\n\\n                 12.8.1   CLAIMS INITIATED BY INDEMNITEE.  Initiated or brought\\n         voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, but such\\n         indemnification or advancement of Expenses may be provided by the\\n         Corporation in specific cases if the Board of Directors finds it to be\\n         appropriate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall\\n         provide indemnification including the advancement of Expenses with\\n         respect to Proceedings brought to establish or enforce a right to\\n         indemnification under these Articles or any other statute or law or as\\n         otherwise required under the statute.\\n\\n                 12.8.2   LACK OF GOOD FAITH.  Instituted by Indemnitee to\\n         enforce or interpret this Article, if a court of competent\\n         jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by\\n         Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was\\n         frivolous.\\n\\n                 12.8.3   INSURED CLAIMS.  For which any of the Expenses or\\n         liabilities for indemnification is being sought have been paid\\n         directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under a policy of\\n         officers\\' and directors\\' liability insurance maintained by the\\n         Corporation.\\n\\n                 12.8.4   PROHIBITED BY LAW.  If the Corporation is prohibited\\n         by the Act or other applicable law as then in effect from paying such\\n         indemnification and/or advancement of Expenses.  For example, the\\n         Corporation and Indemnitee acknowledge that the Securities and\\n         Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has taken the position that\\n         indemnification is not possible for liabilities arising under certain\\n         federal securities laws.  Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that\\n         the Corporation has undertaken or may be required in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      -10-\\n<PAGE>   11\\n\\n         the future to undertake with the SEC to submit the question of\\n         indemnification to a court in certain circumstances for a\\n         determination of the Corporation\\'s right to indemnify Indemnitee.\\n\\n         12.9    Successors and Assigns.  All obligations of the Corporation to\\nindemnify any Director or Officer shall be binding upon all successors and\\nassigns of the Corporation (including any transferee of all or substantially\\nall of its assets and any successor by merger or otherwise by operation of\\nlaw).  The Corporation shall not effect any sale of substantially all of its\\nassets, merger, consolidation, or other reorganization, in which it is not the\\nsurviving entity, unless the surviving entity agrees in writing to assume all\\nsuch obligations of the Corporation.\\n\\n\\n                                  ARTICLE XIII\\n\\n                  CORPORATION\\'S ACQUISITION OF ITS OWN SHARES\\n\\n         The Corporation may purchase, redeem, receive, take or otherwise\\nacquire, own and hold, sell, lend, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of,\\npledge, use and otherwise deal with and in its own shares.

Exercise of Option.\\n\\n                 (a)  Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder. Any\\nOption granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such\\nconditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant, and as shall be\\npermissible under the terms of the Plan.\\n\\n                 An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.\\n\\n                 An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when written notice\\nof such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of\\nthe Option by the person entitled to exercise the Option and full payment for\\nthe Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by\\nthe Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any\\nconsideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(c) of the Plan.\\nUntil the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the\\nCompany or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock\\ncertificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or\\nany other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned\\nStock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.  The Company shall issue (or\\ncause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly upon exercise of the\\nOption.  In the event that the exercise of an Option is treated in part as the\\nexercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a\\nNonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 5(b), the Company shall issue a\\nstock certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise\\nof an Incentive Stock Option and a separate stock certificate evidencing the\\nShares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option,\\nand shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its stock transfer\\nrecords.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which\\nthe record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as\\nprovided in Section 11 of the Plan.\\n\\n                 Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease\\nin the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of\\nthe Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the\\nOption is exercised.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       6\\n<PAGE>   7\\n\\n\\n                 (b)  Termination of Status as Employee.  In the event of\\ntermination of an Optionee\\'s Continuous Status as an Employee, such Optionee\\nmay exercise stock options to the extent exercisable on the date of\\ntermination.  Such exercise must occur within three (3) months (or such shorter\\ntime as may be specified in the grant), after the date of such termination (but\\nin no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set\\nforth in the Option Agreement).  To the extent that the Optionee was not\\nentitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or does not\\nexercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall\\nterminate.\\n\\n                 (c)  Disability of Optionee.  Notwithstanding the provisions\\nof Section 9(b) above, in the event of termination of an Optionee\\'s Continuous\\nStatus as an Employee as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., the\\ninability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any\\nmedically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to\\nresult in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous\\nperiod of twelve (12) months), the Optionee may exercise the Option, but only\\nto the extent of the right to exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee\\nremained in Continuous Status as an Employee for a period of twelve (12) months\\nafter the date on which the Employee ceased working as a result of the total\\nand permanent disability.  Such exercise must occur within eighteen (18) months\\n(or such shorter time as is specified in the grant) from the date on which the\\nEmployee ceased working as a result of the total and permanent disability (but\\nin no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set\\nforth in the Option Agreement).  To the extent that the Optionee was not\\nentitled to exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option\\nshall terminate.\\n\\n                 (d)  Death of Optionee.  Notwithstanding the provisions of\\nSection 9(b) above, in the event of the death of an Optionee:\\n\\n                          (i)  who is at the time of death an Employee of the\\nCompany, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months\\nfollowing the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration\\nof the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the\\nOptionee\\'s estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option\\nby bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that\\nwould have accrued had the Optionee continued living and remained in Continuous\\nStatus as an Employee twelve (12) months after the date of death; or\\n\\n                          (ii)  whose Option has not yet expired but whose\\nContinuous Status as an Employee terminated prior to the date of death, the\\nOption may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date\\nof death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such\\nOption as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee\\'s estate or by a\\nperson who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance,\\nbut only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date of\\ntermination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       7\\n<PAGE>   8\\n\\n\\n                 (e)  Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) above, the\\nBoard shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding\\noption in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate\\n(provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an option beyond the\\ndate on which the option would have expired if no termination of the Employee\\'s\\nContinuous Status as an Employee had occurred).\\n\\n         10.     Non-Transferability of Options.  The Option may not be sold,\\npledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner\\nother than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be\\nexercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.\\n\\n         11.     Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger. Subject\\nto any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares\\nof Common Stock covered by each outstanding Option, the Maximum Annual Employee\\nGrant and the number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for\\nissuance under the Plan but as to which no Options have yet been granted or\\nwhich have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an\\nOption, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such\\noutstanding Option, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or\\ndecrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock\\nsplit, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, or reclassification of\\nthe Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued\\nshares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the\\nCompany; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of\\nthe Company shall not be deemed to have been \"effected without receipt of\\nconsideration.\"  Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose\\ndetermination in that respect shall be final, binding, and conclusive.  Except\\nas expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of\\nany class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall\\naffect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the\\nnumber or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option.\\n\\n                 In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the\\nCompany, the Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of\\nsuch proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board.  The Board may,\\nin the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any\\nOption shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Optionee\\nthe right to exercise an Option as to all or any part of the Optioned Stock,\\nincluding Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable.  In\\nthe event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the\\nCompany, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each\\nOption shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such\\nsuccessor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation,\\nunless such successor corporation does not agree to assume the Option or to\\nsubstitute an equivalent option, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such\\nassumption or substitution, provide for the Optionee to have the right to\\nexercise the Option as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to\\nwhich the Option would not otherwise be exercisable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       8\\n<PAGE>   9\\n\\nIf the Board makes an Option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or\\nsubstitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify\\nthe Optionee that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen\\n(15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option will terminate upon the\\nexpiration of such period.\\n\\n         12.     Time of Granting Options.  The date of grant of an Option\\nshall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Company completes the\\ncorporate action relating to the grant of an option and all conditions to the\\ngrant have been satisfied, provided that conditions to the exercise of an\\noption shall not defer the date of grant.  Notice of a grant shall be given to\\neach Employee to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after\\nthe determination has been made.\\n\\n         13.     Substitutions and Assumptions.  The Board shall have the right\\nto substitute or assume Options in connection with mergers, reorganizations,\\nseparations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies,\\nprovided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the\\nCode and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  The number of Shares reserved\\npursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Options\\nassumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number\\nof Shares subject to Options before and after the substitution.\\n\\n         14.     Amendment and Termination of the Plan.\\n\\n                 (a)  Amendment and Termination.  The Board may amend or\\nterminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem\\nadvisable (including, but not limited to amendments which the Board deems\\nappropriate to enhance the Company\\'s ability to claim deductions related to\\nstock option exercises); provided that, the following revisions or amendments\\nshall require approval of or ratification by the stockholders of the Company:\\n\\n                          (i)  any increase in the number of Shares subject to\\nthe Plan, other than in connection with an adjustment under Section 11 of the\\nPlan; or\\n\\n                          (ii)  if the Company has a class of equity securities\\nregistered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act at the time of such revision or\\namendment, any change which would require stockholder approval pursuant to Rule\\n16b-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to its\\nauthority under the Exchange Act.\\n\\n                 (b)  Employees in Foreign Countries.  The Board shall have the\\nauthority to adopt such modifications, procedures, and subplans as may be\\nnecessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign\\ncountries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries may operate to assure the\\nviability of the benefits from Options granted to Employees employed in such\\ncountries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       9\\n<PAGE>   10\\n\\n\\n                 (c)  Effect of Amendment or Termination.

Purpose of the Plan.  The purpose of this Plan is to provide\\neligible employees who wish to become shareholders in the Company a convenient\\nmethod of doing so.  It is believed that employee participation in the\\nownership of the business will be to the mutual benefit of both the employees\\nand the Company.  It is the intention of the Company to have the Plan qualify\\nas an \"employee stock purchase plan\" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue\\nCode of 1986. The provisions of the Plan shall, accordingly, be construed so as\\nto extend and limit participation in a manner consistent with the requirements\\nof that Section of the Code.\\n\\n         2.      Definitions.\\n\\n                  2.1  \"Base pay\" means regular straight time earnings, plus\\nreview cycle bonuses and overtime payments, payments for incentive\\ncompensation, and other special payments except to the extent that any such\\nitem is specifically excluded by the Board of Directors of the Company (the\\n\"Board\").\\n\\n                  2.2  \"Account\" shall mean the funds accumulated with respect\\nto an individual employee as a result of deductions from his paycheck for the\\npurpose of purchasing stock under this Plan. The funds allocated to an\\nemployee\\'s account shall remain the property of the respective employee at all\\ntimes but may be commingled with the general funds of the Company.\\n\\n         3.      Employees Eligible to Participate.  Any regular employee of\\nthe Company or any of its subsidiaries who is in the employ of the Company on\\none or more offering dates is eligible to participate in the Plan, except (a)\\nemployees whose customary employment is 20 hours or less per week, and (b)\\nemployees whose customary employment is for not more than five months in any\\ncalendar year.\\n\\n         4.      Offerings.  There will be twelve separate consecutive\\nsix-month offerings pursuant to the Plan.  The first offering shall commence on\\nJanuary 1, 1991. Thereafter, offerings shall commence on each subsequent July 1\\nand January 1, and the final offering under this Plan shall commence on July 1,\\n1996 and terminate on December 31, 1996.  In order to become eligible to\\npurchase shares, an employee must sign an Enrollment Agreement, and any other\\nnecessary papers on or before the commencement date (January 1 or July 1) of\\nthe particular offering in which he wishes to participate.  Participation in\\none offering under the Plan shall neither limit, nor require, participation in\\nany other offering.\\n\\n         5.      Price.  The purchase price per share shall be the lesser of\\n(1) 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the offering date; or (2) 85%\\nof the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the offering.\\nFair market value shall mean the closing bid price as reported on the National\\nAssociation of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or, if the stock\\nis traded on a stock exchange, the closing price for the stock on the principal\\nsuch exchange.\\n\\n         6.      Offering Date.  The \"offering date\" as used in this Plan shall\\nbe the commencement date of the offering, if such date is a regular business\\nday, or the first regular business day following such commencement date.  A\\ndifferent date may be set by resolution of the Board.\\n\\n         7.      Number of Shares to be Offered.  The maximum number of shares\\nthat will be offered under the Plan is 6,750,000. The shares to be sold to\\nparticipants under the Plan will be common stock of the Company.  If the total\\nnumber of shares for which options are to be granted on any date in accordance\\nwith Section 10 exceeds the number of shares then available under the Plan\\n(after deduction of all shares for which options have been exercised or are\\nthen outstanding), the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares\\nremaining available in as nearly\\n\\n\\n                                       2\\n<PAGE>   3\\n\\na uniform manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be\\nequitable.  In such event, the payroll deductions to be made pursuant to the\\nauthorizations therefor shall be reduced accordingly and the Company shall give\\nwritten notice of such reduction to each employee affected thereby.\\n\\n         8.      Participation.\\n\\n                  8.1  An eligible employee may become a participant by\\ncompleting an Enrollment Agreement provided by the Company and filing it with\\nShareholder Services prior to the Commencement of the offering to which it\\nrelates.\\n\\n                  8.2  Payroll deductions for a participant shall commence on\\nthe offering date, and shall end on the termination date of such offering\\nunless earlier terminated by the employee as provided in Paragraph 14.\\n\\n         9.      Payroll Deductions.\\n\\n                  9.1  At the time a participant files his authorization for a\\npayroll deduction, he shall elect to have deductions made from his pay on each\\npayday during the time he is a participant in an offering at the rate of 2%,\\n4%, 6%, 8%, or 10% of his base pay.\\n\\n                  9.2  All payroll deductions made for a participant shall be\\ncredited to his account under the Plan.  A participant may not make any\\nseparate cash payment into such account nor may payment for shares be made\\nother than by payroll deduction.\\n\\n                  9.3  A participant may discontinue his participation in the\\nPlan as provided in Section 14, but no other change can be made during an\\noffering and, specifically, a participant may not alter the rate of his payroll\\ndeductions for that offering.\\n\\n         10.     Granting of Option.  On the offering date, this Plan shall be\\ndeemed to have granted to the participant an option for as many full shares as\\nhe will be able to purchase with the payroll deductions credited to his account\\nduring his participation in that offering.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no\\nparticipant may purchase more than 2,250 shares of stock during any single\\noffering.\\n\\n         11.     Exercise of Option.  Each employee who continues to be a\\nparticipant in an offering on the last business day of that offering shall be\\ndeemed to have exercised his option on such date and shall be deemed to have\\npurchased from the Company such number of full shares of common stock reserved\\nfor the purpose of the Plan as his accumulated payroll deductions on such date\\nwill pay for at the option price.\\n\\n         12.     Employee\\'s Rights as a Shareholder. No participating employee\\nshall have any right as a shareholder with respect to any shares until the\\nshares have been purchased in accordance with Section 11 above and the stock\\nhas been issued by the Company.\\n\\n         13.     Evidence of Stock Ownership.\\n\\n                 13.1  Promptly following the end of each offering, the number\\nof shares of common stock purchased by each participant shall be deposited into\\nan account established in the participant\\'s name at a stock brokerage or other\\nfinancial services firm designated by the Company (the \"ESPP Broker\").\\n\\n                 13.2  The participant may direct, by written notice to the\\nCompany at the time of his enrollment in the Plan, that his ESPP Broker account\\nbe established in the names of the participant and one other person designated\\nby the participant, as joint tenants with right of survivorship, tenants in\\ncommon, or community property, to the extent and in the manner permitted by\\napplicable law.\\n\\n                 13.3  A participant shall be free to undertake a disposition\\n(as that term is defined in Section 424(c) of the Code) of the shares in his\\naccount at any time, whether by sale, exchange, gift, or other transfer of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       3\\n<PAGE>   4\\n\\nlegal title, but in the absence of such a disposition of the shares, the shares\\nmust remain in the participant\\'s account at the ESPP Broker until the holding\\nperiod set forth in Section 423(a) of the Code has been satisfied.  With\\nrespect to shares for which the Section 423(a) holding period has been\\nsatisfied, the participant may move those shares to another brokerage account\\nof participant\\'s choosing or request that a stock certificate be issued and\\ndelivered to him.\\n\\n                 13.4  A participant who is not subject to payment of U.S.\\nincome taxes may move his shares to another brokerage account of his choosing\\nor request that a stock certificate be issued and delivered to him at any time,\\nwithout regard to the satisfaction of the Section 423(a) holding period.\\n\\n         14.     Withdrawal.\\n\\n                  14.1  An employee may withdraw from an offering, in whole but\\nnot in part, at any time prior to the last business day of such offering by\\ndelivering a Withdrawal Notice to the Company, in which event the Company will\\nrefund the entire balance of his deductions as soon as practicable thereafter.\\n\\n                  14.2  To re-enter the Plan, an employee who has previously\\nwithdrawn must file a new Enrollment Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1.\\nThe employee\\'s re-entry into the Plan will not become effective before the\\nbeginning of the next offering following his withdrawal, and if the withdrawing\\nemployee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the\\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 he may not re-enter the Plan before the\\nbeginning of the second offering following his withdrawal.\\n\\n         15.     Carryover of Account.  At the termination of each offering the\\nCompany shall automatically re-enroll the employee in the next offering, and\\nthe balance in the employee\\'s account shall be used for option exercises in the\\nnew offering, unless the employee has advised the Company otherwise.  Upon\\ntermination of the Plan, the balance of each employee\\'s account shall be\\nrefunded to him.\\n\\n         16.     Interest.  No interest will be paid or allowed on any money in\\nthe accounts of participating employees.\\n\\n         17.     Rights Not Transferable.

If any such action is taken by the employee, or any claim is\\nasserted by any other party in respect of such right and interest whether by\\ngarnishment, levy, attachment or otherwise, such action or claim will be\\ntreated as an election to withdraw funds in accordance with Section 14.\\n\\n         18.     Termination of Employment.  Upon termination of employment for\\nany reason whatsoever, including but not limited to death or retirement, the\\nbalance in the account of a participating employee shall be paid to the\\nemployee or his estate.\\n\\n         19.     Amendment or Discontinuance of the Plan.  The Board shall have\\nthe right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time without notice,\\nprovided that no employee\\'s existing rights under any offering already made\\nunder Section 4 hereof may be adversely affected thereby, and provided further\\nthat no such amendment of the Plan shall, except as provided in Section 20,\\nincrease above 6,750,000 the total number of shares to be offered unless\\nshareholder approval is obtained therefor.\\n\\n         20.

For the foregoing purposes the rules of Section 425(d) of the\\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply in determining share ownership.  In\\naddition, no employee shall be allowed to subscribe for any shares under the\\nPlan which permits his rights to purchase shares under all \"employee stock\\npurchase plans\" of the Company and its subsidiary corporations to accrue at a\\nrate which exceeds $25,000 of the fair market value of such shares (determined\\nat the time such right to subscribe is granted) for each calendar year in which\\nsuch right to subscribe is outstanding at any time.\\n\\n         22.     Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by the Board.\\nThe Board shall be vested with full authority to make, administer, and\\ninterpret such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to administer the\\nPlan, and any determination, decision, or action of the Board in connection\\nwith the construction, interpretation, administration, or application of the\\nPlan shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all participants and any and\\nall persons claiming under or through any participant.\\n\\n         The Board may delegate any or all of its authority hereunder to such\\ncommittee as it may designate.\\n\\n         23.     Notices.  All notices or other communications by a participant\\nto the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have\\nbeen duly given when received by Shareholder Services of the Company or when\\nreceived in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the\\nperson, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.\\n\\n         24.

Limitations on Sale of Stock Purchased Under the Plan. The\\nPlan is intended to provide common stock for investment and not for resale.\\nThe Company does not, however, intend to restrict or influence any employee in\\nthe conduct of his own affairs.  An employee, therefore, may sell stock\\npurchased under the Plan at any time he chooses, subject to compliance with any\\napplicable Federal or state securities laws.  THE EMPLOYEE ASSUMES THE RISK OF\\nANY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF THE STOCK.\\n\\n         26.     Governmental Regulation.  The Company\\'s obligation to sell and\\ndeliver shares of the Company\\'s common stock under this Plan is subject to the\\napproval of any governmental authority required in connection with the\\nauthorization, issuance, or sale of such shares.\\n\\n         [The number of shares set forth in Sections 7, 10, and 19 have been\\nchanged to reflect the effect of three-for-two stock splits in 1991 and 1992,\\nand a two-for-one stock split in 1994.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

The employer contribution shall\\nmatch 50% of each participant\\'s contribution in any plan year up to six percent\\nof the participant\\'s compensation for the plan year, for a maximum employer\\nmatching contribution of three percent of compensation.  The matching\\ncontribution shall be allocated to the participant\\'s employer contribution\\naccount.  The employer may from time to time change the amount of the employer\\nmatching contribution, provided any decrease in the matching contribution\\nformula must be effective only for matching elective deferrals after the date\\nof change.  Total employer contributions for any plan year shall not exceed the\\nmaximum amount which is deductible by the employer for federal income tax\\npurposes.

Preparticipation\\nservice with certain companies as set forth in Appendix II, attached hereto and\\nincorporated herein, shall be counted toward vesting.\\n\\n         5.3     YEARS OF SERVICE.  An employee\\'s years of service at any date\\nshall equal the number of years, including fractional portions of years, which\\nhave elapsed between the date the employee first performed an hour of service,\\nor first performed an hour of service upon reemployment, and the date a period\\nof severance begins.  If a period of severance is less than twelve months, the\\nperiod of severance shall be included in determining years of service.\\n\\n         5.4     HOUR OF SERVICE.

A period of severance is a period which\\nbegins on the earlier of (i) the date the employee quits, is discharged,\\nretires, dies; or (ii) the first anniversary of the date the employee is absent\\nfrom service for any other reason, such as disability leave, vacation, or leave\\nof absence; and which ends when the employee performs an hour of service upon\\nreemployment.  However, if an employee is absent from employment for maternity\\nor paternity reasons, the period of severance shall begin on the second\\nanniversary of the first date of such absence.  The period between the first\\nand second anniversaries of the first date of absence from work is neither a\\nyear or fractional year of service, nor a period of severance.  An absence for\\nmaternity or paternity reasons includes an absence because of the following:\\npregnancy of the individual, birth of a child of the individual, placement of a\\nchild with the individual in connection with the adoption of such child by such\\nindividual or caring for such child for a period beginning immediately\\nfollowing such birth or placement.\\n\\n         5.6     FORFEITURES.

Such non-vested interests\\nof terminated participants shall be held by the trustee in a separate\\nforfeiture suspense account until the expiration of a one-year period of\\nseverance when the forfeitures shall be available for distribution as set forth\\nin Article IV.  If the participant is reemployed before sustaining five\\nconsecutive one-year periods of severance, any amount forfeited shall be\\nrestored to his or her employer contribution account, unadjusted by any gains\\nor losses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      5-2\\n<PAGE>   15\\n\\n                                   ARTICLE VI\\n\\n                     PARTICIPANTS\\' ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS\\n\\n         6.1     INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS.  The trustee shall maintain records to\\nshow the interest in the Plan of each participant and former participant.  Such\\nrecords shall be in the form of individual accounts.  When appropriate, a\\nparticipant shall have two accounts, a salary deferral account and an employer\\ncontribution account.  The maintenance of individual accounts is only for\\naccounting purposes, and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each\\naccount shall not be required.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent\\nprovided in a written loan policy, a loan made to a participant will be treated\\nas a participant direction of investment.  The participant alone shares in any\\nprincipal and interest paid on the loan, and he or she alone bears any expense\\nor loss incurred in connection with the loan.  The Trustee will reflect the\\nparticipant\\'s loan on his or her account.  Distributions and withdrawals made\\nfrom an account shall be charged to the account as of the date paid.  Each\\nparticipant and former participant shall be advised from time to time, but at\\nleast once a year, as to the status of his or her account or accounts.\\n\\n         6.2     INVESTMENT FUNDS.  The trust fund shall consist of the\\nfollowing investment funds:  common stock funds, bond funds, income funds,\\nmoney market funds, and the Microsoft Corporation stock fund.  The employer may\\nchange the investment funds from time to time.  Each participant and former\\nparticipant shall direct the trustee as to what portion of his or her accounts\\nshall be deposited in each fund (or, in the case of a Participant loan pursuant\\nto Article XIX, what portion of his or her account shall be loaned).  If a\\nparticipant or former participant wishes to utilize more than one investment\\nfund, he or she shall designate the percentage of his or her account balances\\nto be invested in each fund, and the percentages designated shall be in 10%\\nincrements.  The trust fund may hold qualified employer securities and\\nqualified employer real estate in any amount.  The Plan is intended to\\nconstitute a plan described in ERISA Section  404(c), and the fiduciaries of\\nthe Plan may be relieved in accordance with ERISA Section  404(c) of liability\\nfor any losses which are the direct and necessary result of investment\\ninstructions given by a participant or former participant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      6-1\\n<PAGE>   16\\n\\n         6.3     CHANGING ACCOUNT INVESTMENTS.

The dates for changing investment funds may be\\nchanged from time to time by the Plan Administrator.\\n\\n         6.4     PROCEDURES.  The Plan Administrator shall adopt such rules and\\nprocedures as it deems advisable with respect to all matters relating to the\\nselection and use of the investment funds.\\n\\n         6.5     VALUATION OF ACCOUNTS.  As of the end of each plan year, the\\nPlan Administrator shall adjust the net credit balances in the accounts of\\nparticipants or former participants in the trust fund, upward or downward, pro\\nrata, so that the aggregate of such net credit balances will equal the net\\nworth of each investment fund of the trust fund, using fair market values as\\ndetermined by the trustee and after such net worth for the appropriate\\ninvestment fund has been reduced by any expenses (to the extent not paid\\ndirectly by the employer), withdrawals, distributions and transfers chargeable\\nto that investment fund which have been incurred but not yet paid.  All\\ndeterminations made by the trustee with respect to fair market values and net\\nworth shall be made in accordance with generally accepted principles of trust\\naccounting, and such determinations when so made by the trustee shall be\\nconclusive and binding upon all persons having an interest under the Plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      6-2\\n<PAGE>   17\\n\\n                                  ARTICLE VII\\n\\n                        PAYMENT OF ACCOUNT BALANCES UPON\\n                        TERMINATION, DEATH, DISABILITY,\\n                      QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS,\\n                           SALE OF TRADE OR BUSINESS\\n\\n         7.1     TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

Account balances shall be valued as of the most recent\\nvaluation date prior to date of payment and shall be paid in a single cash\\npayment, except that the participant or former participant may elect to receive\\nany or all of the shares allocated to him or her in the Microsoft Corporation\\nstock fund.  Account balances shall be distributed no later than 60 days after\\nthe latest of (i) the plan year in which the participant terminates or (ii) the\\nplan year in which the participant reaches age 65.  Notwithstanding the\\nforegoing, a person\\'s entire interest must be distributed, or must begin to be\\ndistributed, no later than the first day of April following the calendar year\\nin which the participant reaches age 70-1/2.\\n\\n         7.2     PAYMENT AT 59-1/2.

If a participant dies\\nwhile employed, his or her employer contribution account shall be 100% vested.\\nEach participant shall designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive all\\namounts credited to his or her accounts in the event of the participant\\'s\\ndeath.  The accounts shall be valued as of the most recent valuation date prior\\nto payment and shall be paid in a single cash payment to the designated\\nbeneficiary or beneficiaries as soon as feasible after the death.

If a\\nparticipant\\'s employment is terminated prior to retirement because of a total\\nand permanent disability, the employer contribution account shall be 100%\\nvested.  A participant shall be deemed to be totally and permanently disabled\\nif he or she is eligible for and is receiving Social Security disability\\nbenefits.  The participant\\'s accounts shall be valued as of the most recent\\nvaluation date prior to payment and shall be paid in a single cash payment\\nwithin sixty (60) days after the disability has been established under this\\nsection, except that the participant may elect to receive any or all of the\\nshares allocated to him or her in the Microsoft Corporation stock fund.  If the\\nvalue of the participant\\'s accounts exceeds $3,500 (or exceeded $3,500 at the\\ntime of a prior distribution), the participant may elect to receive the balance\\nof his or her accounts upon reaching age 65.\\n\\n         7.5     EARLY RETIREMENT. Upon reaching age 55, a participant may\\nelect early retirement and shall receive the value of his or her salary\\ndeferral account and the vested portion of his or her employer contribution\\naccount, which shall be paid in the time and manner described in Section 7.1 as\\nif the employee had terminated.\\n\\n         7.6     DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS.\\nDistribution to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order\\nas defined in Code Section  414(p) may be made at any time prior to the\\nparticipant\\'s attainment of earliest retirement age if the court order\\nspecifies distribution at an earlier time or permits an agreement between the\\nPlan and the alternate payee to authorize an earlier distribution and the\\nalternate payee consents to the distribution.\\n\\n                 7.6.1    Qualified Status of Order.  The Plan Administrator\\nshall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of a\\ndomestic relations order.

If any\\nportion of the participant\\'s nonforfeitable accrued benefit is payable during\\nthe period the Plan Administrator is making its determination of the qualified\\nstatus of the domestic relations order, the Trustee shall make a separate\\naccounting of the amounts payable.  If the Plan Administrator determines the\\norder is a qualified domestic relations order within 18 months of the date\\namounts first are payable following receipt of the order, the amounts shall be\\npayable in accordance with the order.  If the Plan Administrator does not make\\nits determination of the qualified status of the order within the 18 month\\ndetermination period, the amounts shall be payable in the manner in which they\\nwould be distributed if the order did not exist.  The order shall be applied\\nprospectively if the Plan Administrator determines after the 18 month period\\nthat the order is a qualified domestic relations order.\\n\\n                 7.6.3    Investment of Amounts Payable.  To the extent it is\\nnot inconsistent with the provisions of the qualified domestic relations order,\\nany partitioned funds may be invested in a segregated subaccount and may be\\ninvested in fixed income investments.  A segregated subaccount shall remain a\\npart of the Trust, but it alone shall share in any income it earns, and it\\nalone shall bear any expense or loss it incurs.  The Trustee shall make any\\npayments or distributions to the alternate payee(s) by separate benefit checks\\nor other separate distribution.\\n\\n         7.7     SALE OF TRADE OR BUSINESS.

The income allocable to excess contributions shall be\\ndetermined by multiplying income allocable to the participant\\'s elective\\ndeferrals and qualified employer deferral contributions for the plan year by a\\nfraction, the numerator of which is the excess contribution on behalf of the\\nparticipant for the preceding plan year and the denominator of which is the sum\\nof the participant\\'s account balances attributable to elective deferrals and\\nqualified employer deferral contributions on the last day of the preceding plan\\nyear.  The excess contributions which would otherwise be distributed to the\\nparticipant shall be adjusted for income; shall be reduced, in accordance with\\nregulations, by the amount of excess deferrals distributed to the participant;\\nshall, if there is a loss allocable to the excess contributions, in no event be\\nless than the lesser of the participant\\'s account under the Plan or the\\nparticipant\\'s elective deferrals and qualified employer deferral contributions\\nfor the plan year.

Excess\\naggregate contributions and income allocable thereto shall be distributed no\\nlater than the last day of each plan year to participants to whose accounts\\nemployee contributions or matching contributions were allocated for the\\npreceding plan year.  \"Excess aggregate contributions\" shall mean the amount\\ndescribed in Code Section  401(m)(6)(B).  The income allocable to excess\\naggregate contributions shall be determined by multiplying the income allocable\\nto the participant\\'s employee contributions and matching employer contributions\\nfor the plan year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess aggregate\\ncontributions on behalf of the participant of the preceding plan year and the\\ndenominator of which is the sum of the participant\\'s account balances\\nattributable to employee contributions and matching employer contributions on\\nthe last day of the preceding plan year.  The excess aggregate contributions to\\nbe distributed to a participant shall be adjusted for income, and, if there is\\na loss allocable to the excess aggregate contribution, shall in no event be\\nless than the lesser of the participant\\'s account under the Plan or the\\nparticipant\\'s employee contributions and matching contributions for the plan\\nyear.

Compensation:\\n\\n                 (a)      For all plan years commencing on or after April 1,\\n1989, and prior to January 1, 1994, compensation means an employee\\'s salary or\\nwages paid during the plan year.  Compensation includes bonuses, commissions,\\novertime and salary reduction contributions made by an employee to a benefit\\nplan, but shall not include reimbursement of moving expenses, car allowances,\\nclub dues, income attributable to life insurance, and similar items.\\nNotwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the compensation of each\\nemployee taken into account for any such plan year shall not exceed $200,000,\\nexcept that such $200,000 shall be increased as permitted by Internal Revenue\\nService publication to reflect cost-of-living adjustment.\\n\\n                 (b)      For all plan years commencing on or after January 1,\\n1994, an employee\\'s wages, salaries, fees for professional services, and other\\namounts received (without regard to whether or not an amount is paid in cash)\\nfor personal services actually rendered in the course of employment with the\\nemployer maintaining the plan to the extent that the amounts are includible in\\ngross income (including, but not limited to, bonuses, commissions, and overtime\\npay).  Compensation includes the employee\\'s elective salary reduction\\ncontributions not includible in gross income under Code Section  125 (cafeteria\\nplans) or Section 402(e)(3) (401(k) plans); and compensation includes foreign\\nearned income (as defined in Code Section  911(b)), whether or not excludable\\nfrom gross income under Code Section  911.

Limitations on Compensation\\n\\n                 (a)      In addition to the applicable limitations set forth\\nin the Plan, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the\\ncontrary, for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the annual\\ncompensation of each employee taken into account under the Plan shall not\\nexceed the OBRA \\'93 annual compensation limit.  The OBRA \\'93 annual\\ncompensation limit is $150,000, as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases\\nin the cost of living in accordance with Code Section  401(a)(17)(B).  The\\ncost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period,\\nnot exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (the\\n\"determination period\") beginning in such calendar year.

For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before the first\\ndate of the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the OBRA \\'93\\nannual compensation limit is $150,000.\\n\\n                 For purposes of determining the maximum dollar amount referred\\nto in this provision, the compensation of any participant who is either a 5%\\nowner (as defined in Code Section  416(i)) or one of the ten most highly paid\\nhighly compensated employees during the Plan year shall be aggregated with:\\n(i) the compensation of any lineal descendant who has not attained the age of\\n19, and (ii) the compensation of a participant who is his or her spouse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      I-3\\n<PAGE>   46\\n\\n                                 APPENDIX II\\n\\n                          Sections 1.6, 2.1 and 5.2\\n\\n                        EMPLOYERS MAINTAINING THE PLAN\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\nEmployer                                       Effective Date\\n___________________________________________    ________________________________\\n<S>                                            <C>\\nMicrosoft Corporation                          January 1, 1987\\nTechnology Resources Management Corporation    November 23, 1992\\n</TABLE>                                    \\n\\n            EMPLOYEES\\' PREPARTICIPATION SERVICE WITH THESE COMPANIES\\n                     IS COUNTED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND VESTING\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\nCompany                                        Effective Date Credit is Granted\\n___________________________________________    ________________________________\\n<S>                                            <C>\\nMicrosoft Corporation                          January 1, 1987\\nTechnology Resources Management Corporation    November 23, 1992\\nFox Software, Inc.

For purposes of this definition of\\n\"highly compensated employee\", \"compensation\" means compensation within the\\nmeaning of Code Section  415(c)(3), but including elective or salary reduction\\ncontributions to a cafeteria Plan, cash or deferred arrangement, or\\ntax-sheltered annuity.\\n\\n         III.9.5.B.       Code Section  401(k) Limitations on Compensation\\nDeferrals.\\n\\n                 (a)      The Plan Administrator will estimate as soon as\\npracticable before the close of the plan year and at such other times as the\\nPlan Administrator in its discretion determines, the extent, if any, to which\\nany participant or class of participants will have to reduce contributions\\nunder this Plan.\\n\\n                 (b)      For each plan year, an actual deferral percentage\\nwill be determined for each participant equal to the ratio of the  total amount\\nof the participant\\'s salary deferrals under section 3.1 for the plan year\\ndivided by the participant\\'s compensation in the plan year.  In the case of\\nfamily members treated as a single highly compensated employee under the\\ndefinition of \"highly compensated employee\", in accordance with the family\\naggregation rules of Code Section  414(q)(6), the actual deferral percentage\\nshall be the greater of the (1) the actual deferral\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     III-2\\n<PAGE>   49\\n\\npercentage determined by combining the compensation deferrals and compensation\\nof all eligible family members who are highly compensated employees without\\nregard to family aggregation, and (2) the actual deferral percentage determined\\nby combining the salary deferrals and compensation of all eligible family\\nmembers.

The process in the preceding sentence\\nshall be repeated until the Plan satisfies the limits in (c) above.  In the\\ncase of family members subject to the family aggregation rules of Code Section\\n414(q)(6), excess salary deferrals will be allocated among family members in\\nproportion to the salary deferrals of each family member that have been\\ncombined under section III.9.5.B.(b) above.  Where the actual deferral\\npercentage is determined under section III.9.5.B.(b)(1) above, however, excess\\nsalary deferrals will be allocated first among the eligible highly compensated\\nemployee family members in proportion to the salary deferrals of each such\\nhighly compensated employee family member until the actual deferral percentage\\nof the eligible highly compensated employee family members has been reduced to\\nthe actual deferral percentage of the eligible non-highly compensated employee\\nfamily members.  If reduction of the actual deferral percentage below that of\\nthe eligible non-highly compensated employee family members is required under\\nsection III.9.5.B.(b)(1) to enable the plan to meet the limits in section\\nIII.9.5.B.(c) above, such further reduction shall take into account the salary\\ndeferrals of all eligible family members and shall be allocated among all such\\nfamily members in proportion to their salary deferrals.  The earnings\\nattributable to excess salary deferrals will be determined in accordance with\\nTreasury Regulations.\\n\\n                 (f)      In the discretion of the Plan Administrator, the\\ntests described in this section may be applied by aggregating the Plan with any\\nother defined contribution plans permitted under the Code.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     III-4\\n<PAGE>   51\\n\\n         III.9.5.C.

Any employer\\nmatching contributions or employer contributions treated as salary deferrals\\nunder section III.9.5.B.(b) shall not be used to satisfy the requirements of\\nthis Section III.9.5.B.(a), except as otherwise permitted by the Code or\\nTreasury Regulations.  In the case of family members treated as a single highly\\ncompensated employee under the definition of \"highly compensated employee\" in\\naccordance with the family aggregation rules of Code Section 414(q)(6), the\\ncontribution percentage shall be the greater of (1) the contribution percentage\\ndetermined by combining the employer matching contributions and compensation of\\nall eligible family members who are highly compensated employees without regard\\nto family aggregation, and (2) the actual contribution percentage determined by\\ncombining the employer matching contributions and compensation of all eligible\\nfamily members.  Except to the extent taken into account in the preceding\\nsentence, the employer matching contributions, compensation and all amounts\\ntreated as employer matching contributions of such family members shall be\\ndisregarded for purposes of this section III.9.5.C.

The process in the\\npreceding sentence shall be repeated until the plan satisfies the limits in (b)\\nabove.  In the case of family members subject to the family aggregation rules\\nof Code Section  414(q)(6), excess contributions will be allocated among family\\nmembers in proportion to the employer matching contributions of each family\\nmember that have been combined under section III.9.5.C.(a) above.  Where the\\ncontribution percentage is determined under section III.9.5.C.(a)(1) above,\\nhowever, excess employer matching contributions will be allocated first among\\nthe eligible highly compensated employee family members in proportion to the\\nemployer matching contributions of each such highly compensated employee family\\nmember until the contribution percentage of the eligible highly compensated\\nemployee family members has been reduced to the contribution percentage of the\\neligible non-highly compensated employee family members.  If reduction of the\\ncontribution percentage below that of the eligible non-highly compensated\\nemployee family members is required under section III.9.5.C.(a)(1) to enable\\nthe plan to meet the limits in section A.3(b) above, such further reduction\\nshall take into account the employer matching contributions of all eligible\\nfamily members in proportion to their employer matching contributions.  The\\nearnings attributable to excess contributions will be determined in accordance\\nwith Treasury Regulations.\\n\\n                 (d)      The tests of sections III.9.5.B.(c) and III.9.5.C.(b)\\nshall be met in accordance with the prohibition against the multiple use of the\\nalternative limitation under Code Section  401(m)(9).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     III-6\\n<PAGE>   53\\n\\n                                  APPENDIX IV\\n\\n         IV.18.A.         TOP-HEAVY DEFINITIONS.  The definitions relating to\\ntop-heavy plan provisions are as follows:\\n\\n                 (a)      Key Employee shall mean any employee or former\\nemployee (and the beneficiaries of such employee) who, in the plan year\\ncontaining the determination date, or any of the four preceding plan years is:\\n\\n                           (i)    An officer of the employer having an annual\\ncompensation from the employer greater than 150 percent of the amount in effect\\nunder Code Section   415(b)(1)(A) for any such plan year.  Not more than fifty\\nemployees (or, if fewer, the greater of three employees or ten percent of the\\nemployees), including those employees included under subparagraph (ii), (iii)\\nand (iv) below, shall be considered as officers for purposes of this\\nsubparagraph.\\n\\n                          (ii)    One of the ten employees having an annual\\ncompensation from the employer of more than the amount in effect under Code\\nSection   415(c)(1)(A) in the plan year and owning (or considered as owning\\nwithin the meaning of Code Section 318) the largest interests in the employer.\\n\\n                         (iii)    A five-percent owner of the employer.\\n\\n                          (iv)    A one-percent owner of the employer having an\\nannual compensation (within the meaning of Code Section  414(q)(7)) from the\\nemployer of more than $150,000 for a plan year.\\n\\n         Whether an employee is a five-percent owner or a one-percent owner\\nshall be determined in accordance with Code Section 416(i).  If any individual\\nhas not performed services for the employer at any time during the five year\\nperiod ending on the determination date, any accrued benefit for such\\nindividual shall not be taken into account.\\n\\n                 (b)      Top-Heavy Plan shall mean that this Plan is\\nconsidered top-heavy for any plan year if any of the following conditions\\nexists:\\n\\n                           (i)    If the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds\\n60% and this Plan is not part of any required aggregation group or permissive\\naggregation group of plans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      IV-1\\n<PAGE>   54\\n\\n                          (ii)    If this Plan is a part of a required\\naggregation group of plans but not part of a permissive aggregation group and\\nthe top-heavy ratio for the group of plans exceeds 60%.\\n\\n                         (iii)    If this Plan is a part of a required\\naggregation group and part of a permissive aggregation group of plans and the\\ntop-heavy ratio for the permissive aggregation group exceeds 60%.\\n\\n                 (c)      Top-Heavy Ratios shall mean the ratios calculated as\\nfollows:\\n\\n                           (i)    If the employer maintains one or more defined\\ncontribution plans (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the\\nemployer has not maintained any defined benefit plan which during the 5-year\\nperiod ending on the determination date(s) has or has had accrued benefits, the\\ntop-heavy ratio for this Plan alone or for the required or permissive\\naggregation group as appropriate is a fraction, the numerator of which is the\\nsum of the account balances of all key employees as of the determination\\ndate(s) (including any part of any account balance distributed in the 5-year\\nperiod ending on the determination date(s)), and the denominator of which is\\nthe sum of all account balances (including any part of any account balance\\ndistributed in the 5-year period ending on the determination date(s)), both\\ncomputed in accordance with Code Section  416 and the regulations thereunder.\\nBoth the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio are adjusted to\\nreflect any contribution not actually made as of the determination date, but\\nwhich is required to be taken into account on that date under Code Section  416\\nand the regulations thereunder.\\n\\n                          (ii)    If the employer maintains one or more defined\\ncontribution plans (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the\\nemployer maintains or has maintained one or more defined benefit plans which\\nduring the 5-year period ending on the determination date(s) has or has had any\\naccrued benefits, the top-heavy ratio for any required or permissive\\naggregation group as appropriate is a fraction, the numerator of which is the\\nsum of account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans\\nfor all key employees, determined in accordance with (i) above, and the present\\nvalue of accrued benefits under the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      IV-2\\n<PAGE>   55\\n\\naggregated defined benefit plan or plans for all key employees as of the\\ndetermination date(s), and the denominator of which is the sum of the account\\nbalances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans for all\\nparticipants, determined in accordance with (i) above, and the present value of\\naccrued benefits under the defined benefit plan or plans for all participants\\nas of the determination date(s), all determined in accordance with Code Section\\n416 and the regulations thereunder.  The accrued benefits under a defined\\nbenefit plan in both the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio are\\nadjusted for any distribution of an accrued benefit made in the five-year\\nperiod ending on the determination date.\\n\\n                         (iii)    For purposes of (i) and (ii) above the value\\nof account balances and the present value of accrued benefits will be\\ndetermined as of the most recent valuation date that falls within or ends with\\nthe 12-month period ending on the determination date, except as provided in\\nCode Section  416 and the regulations thereunder for the first and second plan\\nyears of a defined benefit plan.  The account balances and accrued benefits of\\na participant (1) who is not a key employee but who was a key employee in a\\nprior year, or (2) who has not been credited with at least one hour of service\\nwith any employer maintaining the Plan at any time during the 5-year period\\nending on the determination date will be disregarded.  The calculation of the\\ntop-heavy ratio, and the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and\\ntransfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Code Section\\n416 and the regulations thereunder.  Deductible employee contributions will not\\nbe taken into account for purposes of computing the top-heavy ratio.  When\\naggregating plans the value of account balances and accrued benefits will be\\ncalculated with reference to the determination dates that fall within the same\\ncalendar year.\\n\\n                 (d)      Permissive Aggregation Group shall mean the required\\naggregation group of plans plus any other plan or plans of the employer which,\\nwhen considered as a group with the required aggregation group, would continue\\nto satisfy the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410.\\n\\n                 (e)      Required Aggregation Group shall mean each qualified\\nplan of the employer in which at least one key employee participates or\\nparticipated at any time during the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      IV-3\\n<PAGE>   56\\n\\ndetermination period (regardless of whether the plan has terminated), and any\\nother qualified plan of the employer which enables such a plan to, meet the\\nrequirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) or Section 410.\\n\\n                 (f)      Determination Date shall mean for any plan year\\nsubsequent to the first plan year, the last day of the preceding plan year; for\\nthe first plan year of the Plan, the last day of that year.\\n\\n                 (g)      Valuation Date shall mean the date as of which\\naccount balances or accrued benefits are valued for purposes of calculating the\\ntop-heavy ratio.\\n\\n                 (h)      Present value shall be based only on the interest and\\nmortality rates specified in the adoption agreement.\\n\\n         IV.18.B.         MINIMUM ALLOCATION.\\n\\n         The employer contributions and forfeitures allocated on behalf of any\\nparticipant employed on the last day of the plan year, who is not a key\\nemployee, shall not be less than the lesser of three percent of such\\nparticipant\\'s compensation or in the case where the employer has no defined\\nbenefit plan which designates this plan to satisfy Code Section  401, the\\nlargest percentage of employer contributions and forfeitures, as a percentage\\nof the first $150,000 (or the adjusted limitation under Code Section\\n401(a)(17)) of the key employee\\'s compensation, allocated on behalf of any key\\nemployee for that year.  If the highest rate allocated to a key employee for a\\nyear in which the Plan is top heavy is less than 3%, amounts contributed as a\\nresult of a salary deferral agreement shall be included in determining\\ncontributions made on behalf of key employees.  The minimum allocation is\\ndetermined without regard to any Social Security contribution.  This minimum\\nallocation shall be made even though, under other plan provisions, the\\nparticipant would not otherwise be entitled to receive an allocation, or would\\nhave received a lesser allocation for the year because of (1) the participant\\'s\\nfailure to complete 1,000 hours of service (or any equivalent provided in the\\nPlan), or (2) the participant\\'s failure to make mandatory employee\\ncontributions to the Plan, or (3) compensation less than a stated amount.  An\\nallocation under this section shall not be made if the participant is covered\\nunder any other plan or plans of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      IV-4\\n<PAGE>   57\\n\\nthe employer and the minimum allocation or benefit requirement applicable to\\ntop-heavy plans will be met in the other plan or plans.  The definition of\\ncompensation in section 1.3 of the Plan shall be the definition for determining\\nminimum allocations under this section.  This definition shall be used for all\\ntop-heavy purposes, including determining whether an employee is a key\\nemployee.\\n\\n         The employer has caused this restated Plan to be duly executed on this\\n_____ day of June, 1994.\\n\\n                                          MICROSOFT CORPORATION\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          By _________________________________\\n                                          Title: _____________________________\\n                                          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      IV-5\\n</TEXT>\\n</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>\\n<TYPE>EX-11\\n<SEQUENCE>9\\n<DESCRIPTION>EXHIBIT 11\\n<TEXT>\\n\\n<PAGE>   1\\n\\n                                                                     EXHIBIT 11.\\n\\n                       COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE\\n                    (In millions, except earnings per share)\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                                                          Year Ended June 30\\n                                                                                     1992         1993       1994\\n                                                                                    -----        -----      ------\\n<S>                                                                                 <C>          <C>        <C>\\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding . . . . . . . . . . . .          533          556         571\\nCommon equivalent shares from outstanding stock options. . . . . . . . . . .           55           50          39\\n                                                                                    -----        -----      ------\\nAverage common and common equivalent shares outstanding (1) (2). . . . . . .          588          606         610\\n                                                                                    =====        =====      ======\\nNet income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        $ 708        $ 953      $1,146\\n                                                                                    =====        =====      ======\\nEarnings per share (1) (2) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        $1.20        $1.57      $ 1.88\\n                                                                                    =====        =====      ======\\n</TABLE>\\n\\n- -------------------\\n\\n(1) Fully diluted earnings per share have not been presented because the \\n    effects are not material.\\n\\n(2) Share and per share amounts for the years ended June 30, 1992 and 1993 have\\n    been restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split in May 1994.\\n</TEXT>\\n</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>\\n<TYPE>EX-13\\n<SEQUENCE>10\\n<DESCRIPTION>EXHIBIT 13\\n<TEXT>\\n\\n<PAGE>   1\\n\\n                                                                     EXHIBIT 13\\n                               FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n(In millions, except earnings per share)                       Year Ended June 30\\n                                         -------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                          1990            1991         1992         1993         1994\\n                                         ------          ------       ------       ------       ------\\n <S>                                     <C>             <C>          <C>          <C>          <C>\\n Net revenues                            $1,183          $1,843       $2,759       $3,753       $4,649\\n Net income                                 279             463          708          953        1,146\\n Earnings per share                        0.52            0.82         1.20         1.57         1.88\\n Return on net revenues                    23.6%           25.1%        25.7%        25.4%        24.7%\\n Cash and short-term investments         $  449          $  686       $1,345       $2,290       $3,614\\n Total assets                             1,105           1,644        2,640        3,805        5,363\\n Stockholders\\' equity                       919           1,351        2,193        3,242        4,450\\n</TABLE>\\n\\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\\n\\n         Due in large measure to the ongoing success of the Microsoft(R)\\nWindows(TM) operating system and Microsoft Office, Microsoft posted its 19th\\nconsecutive year of revenue and earnings growth.\\n\\n         Revenues were $4.65 billion in 1994, an increase of 24% over the $3.75\\nbillion recorded the preceding year.

Operating systems product group revenues were $1,104 \\nmillion, $1,267 million, and $1,519 million in 1992, 1993, and 1994.  The \\nMS-DOS(R) operating system is preinstalled on PCs by most original equipment \\nmanufacturers (OEMs), and revenues from such licenses increased steadily in \\nboth 1993 and 1994.  Revenues from retail upgrade versions of MS-DOS decreased \\nin 1994 after a strong increase in 1993.  The Microsoft Windows operating \\nsystem was an increasingly strong contributor to systems revenues as the number \\nof new PCs preinstalled with Windows increased rapidly during the \\nthree-year period.\\n\\n         Applications product group revenues were $1,401 million, $2,253\\nmillion, and $2,927 million in 1992, 1993, and 1994.  Increases in applications\\nrevenues were led by strong sales of Microsoft Office.  The Microsoft Office\\nStandard product includes Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, the Microsoft\\nPowerPoint(R) presentation graphics program, and a Microsoft Mail license,\\nwhile the Microsoft Office Professional product also includes Microsoft\\nAccess(R) database.  Sales of stand-alone versions of the Microsoft Excel\\nspreadsheet and the Microsoft Word word processor increased in 1993 but\\ndecreased in 1994 as the sales mix continued to shift to integrated products.\\n\\n         Microsoft Home, a broad range of products in the Company\\'s consumer\\napplications group, also showed continued growth.  The Microsoft Home brand\\nincludes CD-ROM multimedia library titles and products for children\\'s\\ncreativity, personal productivity, and entertainment.\\n\\n         Windows-based software programs represented approximately 85% of\\napplications revenues in 1994, up from 65% in 1992 and 75% in 1993.\\n\\n         Hardware product group revenues were $254 million, $233 million, and\\n$203 million in 1992, 1993, and 1994.  The hardware product group\\'s principal \\nproducts are the Microsoft Mouse and BallPoint(R) Mouse pointing devices.\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n      SYSTEMS REVENUES                 APPLICATIONS REVENUES\\n      ----------------                 ---------------------\\n      YEAR      AMOUNT                 YEAR           AMOUNT\\n      ----      ------                 ----           ------\\n      <S>       <C>                    <C>            <C>\\n      1992      $1,104                 1992           $1,401\\n      1993      $1,267                 1993           $2,253\\n      1994      $1,519                 1994           $2,927    \\n</TABLE>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       3\\n<PAGE>   5\\n\\n                  MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (cont.)\\n                                 (In millions)\\n\\n\\nSales channels.  The Company has four major channels of distribution including:\\nfinished goods sales in the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and Other International;\\nand OEM.  Sales in the finished goods channels are primarily to distributors\\nand resellers.  OEM channel revenues are license fees from original equipment\\nmanufacturers.\\n\\n         U.S. and Canada channel revenues were $1,062 million, $1,371 million,\\nand $1,575 million in 1992, 1993, and 1994.  \\n\\n        Revenues in Europe were $997 million, $1,259 million, and $1,363\\nmillion in 1992, 1993, and 1994.  Other International channel revenues\\nincreased 36% in 1994 to $532 million.  Revenues were $223 million in 1992 and\\n$392 million in 1993.  \\n\\n         The Company\\'s operating results are affected by foreign exchange \\nrates.  Approximately 46%, 44%, and 40% of the Company\\'s revenues were\\ncollected in foreign currencies during 1992, 1993, and 1994.  Since much of the\\nCompany\\'s international manufacturing costs and operating expenses are also\\nincurred in local currencies, the relative impact of exchange rates on net\\nincome is less than on revenues.\\n\\n         OEM revenues grew 61% from the prior year to $1,179 million.  OEM\\nrevenues were $477 million in 1992 and $731 million in 1993.  The primary\\nsource of OEM revenues is licenses of operating systems, particularly MS-DOS\\nand Microsoft Windows.

The following issues and risks, among others, should also be\\nconsidered in evaluating its outlook.\\n\\n         Rapid technological change.  The personal computer software industry\\nis characterized by rapid technological change and uncertainty as to the\\nwidespread acceptance of new products.\\n\\n         Long-term investment cycle.  Developing, manufacturing, and licensing\\nsoftware is expensive and the investment in product development often involves\\na long pay-back cycle.  The Company began investing in the principal products\\nthat are significant to its current revenues in the early 1980s.  The Company\\'s\\nplans for 1995 include significant investments in software research and\\ndevelopment and related product opportunities from which significant revenues\\nare not anticipated for a number of years.\\n\\n         Product ship schedules.  Delays in the release of new products can\\ncause operational inefficiencies that impact manufacturing capabilities,\\ndistribution logistics, and telephone support staffing.\\n\\n         Microsoft Office.  Revenues from Microsoft Office may increase as a\\npercentage of total revenues in 1995.  The price of Microsoft Office is less\\nthan the sum of the prices for the individual application programs included in\\nthis product when such programs are sold separately.\\n\\n         Prices.  Future prices the Company is able to obtain for its products\\nmay decrease from historical levels depending upon market or other cost\\nfactors.\\n\\n         Saturation.  Product upgrades, enabling users to upgrade from earlier\\nversions of the Company\\'s products or from competitors\\' products, have lower\\nprices than new products.  As the desktop PC software market becomes saturated,\\nthe sales mix shifts from standard products to upgrade products.  This trend is\\nexpected to continue in 1995.\\n\\n         Introductory pricing.  The Company has offered certain new products at\\nlow introductory prices.  This practice may continue with other new product\\nofferings.\\n\\n         Channel mix.  Average revenue per license is lower from OEM licenses\\nthan from retail versions, reflecting the relatively lower direct costs of\\noperations in the OEM channel.  An increasingly higher percentage of revenues\\nwas achieved through the OEM channel during 1993 and 1994.\\n\\n         Volume discounts.  In 1994, unit sales increased under Microsoft\\nSelect, a large account program designed to permit large organizations to\\nlicense Microsoft products.  Average revenue per copy from Select license\\nprograms is lower than average revenue per copy from retail versions shipped\\nthrough the finished goods channels.\\n\\n         Foreign exchange.  A large percentage of the Company\\'s sales are\\ntransacted in local currencies.  As a result, the Company\\'s revenues are\\nsubject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\n\\n         Cost of revenues.  Although cost of revenues as a percentage of net\\nrevenues was relatively consistent in 1993 and 1994, it varies with channel mix\\nand product mix within channels.  Changes in channel and product mix, as well\\nas in the cost of product components, may affect cost of revenues as a\\npercentage of net revenues in 1995.\\n\\n         Sales and marketing and support investments.  The Company\\'s plans for\\n1995 include continued investments in its sales and marketing and support\\ngroups.  Competitors may be able to enter the market without making investments\\nof such scale.\\n\\n         Accounting standards.  Accounting standards promulgated by the\\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board change periodically.  Changes in such\\nstandards, including currently proposed changes in the accounting for employee\\nstock option plans, may have a negative impact on the Company\\'s future reported\\nearnings.\\n\\n         Unlicensed copying.  Unlicensed copying of software represents a loss\\nof revenues to the Company.  The Company is actively educating consumers and\\nlawmakers on this issue. However, there can be no assurance that continued\\nefforts will affect revenues positively.\\n\\n         Growth rates.  Management believes the Company\\'s recent revenue growth\\nrates are not sustainable.  Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues may\\nincrease in 1995 because of the above factors, among others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       6\\n<PAGE>   8\\n\\n                  MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (cont.)\\n                                 (In millions)\\n\\n\\n         Litigation.  Litigation regarding intellectual property rights,\\npatents, and copyrights is increasing in the PC software industry.  In\\naddition, there are other general corporate legal risks.  See Notes To\\nFinancial Statements regarding contingencies related to government regulation\\nand legal proceedings.\\n\\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\\n\\nThe Company\\'s cash and short-term investments totaled $3,614 million at June\\n30, 1994 and represented 67% of total assets.  The portfolio is diversified\\namong security types, industries, and individual issuers.  The Company\\'s\\ninvestments are investment grade and liquid.\\n\\n         Microsoft has no material long-term debt. Stockholders\\' equity at June\\n30, 1994 was over $4.4 billion.\\n\\n         Cash generated from operations has been sufficient to fund the\\nCompany\\'s investment in research and development activities and facilities\\nexpansion.  As the Company grows, investments will continue in research and\\ndevelopment in existing and advanced areas of technology.  The Company\\'s cash\\nwill be used to acquire technology or to fund strategic ventures.  Additions to\\nproperty, plant, and equipment are expected to continue, including facilities\\nand computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product\\nsupport, and administrative staff.\\n\\n         The exercise of stock options by employees provides additional cash.\\nThese proceeds have funded the Company\\'s open market stock repurchase program\\nthrough which Microsoft provides shares for stock option and stock purchase\\nplans.  This practice is expected to continue in 1995.\\n\\n         The Company has available $70 million of standby multicurrency lines\\nof credit.  These lines support foreign currency hedging and international cash\\nmanagement.\\n\\n         Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together\\nwith funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the Company\\'s\\noperating requirements in 1995.\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING              SALES AND MARKETING SPENDING\\n

Microsoft, every employee is eligible to become a stockholder in the Company\\nthrough the Company\\'s employee stock purchase and stock option plans.\\nManagement believes stock options have made a major contribution to the success\\nof the Company by aligning employee interests with those of other stockholders.\\nStock options enjoy widespread use today, and many of the Company\\'s competitors\\nhave similar programs.\\n\\n         During the last several years there has been considerable debate about\\nthe appropriate accounting for stock options.  Questions in this ongoing\\ndiscussion include how stock options should be measured; whether they should be\\nrecorded in traditional financial statements, subject to already complex and\\nincreasingly difficult rules; whether they should be highlighted in a separate\\nnew financial statement or table; or whether further information concerning\\nstock options should be disclosed in footnotes to financial statements.\\nPending resolution of these outstanding issues, on the accompanying page we\\nhave provided a table of outstanding common shares and net options and changes\\nin their computed values based on quoted prices for the Company\\'s stock.  It\\nprovides a clear understanding of the Company\\'s equity, its equity holders, and\\nthe value or possible value of their vested and unvested holdings.\\n\\n         In this table, common shares are those outstanding.  Net vested and\\nunvested options represent the number of common shares issuable upon exercise\\nof such stock options less the number of common shares that could be\\nrepurchased with proceeds from their exercise.  Computed values are calculated\\nbased on the closing price of the Company\\'s common stock on the Nasdaq National\\nMarket System on the dates indicated.\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                              STAKEHOLDINGS - 1994\\n                              --------------------\\n                        <S>                          <C>\\n                        Employees\\' and Directors\\'    \\n                          Shares and Options         47%\\n                        Other Investors\\' Shares      53%\\n</TABLE>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       11\\n<PAGE>   13\\n\\n                  MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (cont.)\\n                                 (In millions)\\n\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                                           June 30\\n                                                   -----------------------------------------------------\\n                                                    1992        Change     1993        Change     1994\\n                                                   -------      ------    -------      ------    -------\\n<S>                                                <C>          <C>       <C>          <C>       <C>\\nOUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES AND OPTIONS              \\nDirectors\\' and officers\\' common shares                 273         (13)       260         (21)       239\\nEmployees\\' and directors\\' net vested\\n  and unvested stock options                            78         (11)        67          (5)        62                \\n                                                   -------      ------    -------      ------    -------\\nEmployees\\' and directors\\' shares and options           351         (24)       327         (26)       301\\nOther investors\\' common shares                         271          34        305          37        342\\n                                                   -------      ------    -------      ------    -------\\n     Total                                             622          10        632          11        643\\n                                                   =======      ======    =======      ======    =======\\nNasdaq closing price per share                         $35                    $44                $51-5/8\\n                                                   =======                =======                =======\\n\\nCOMPUTED VALUES\\nDirectors\\' and officers\\' common shares             $ 9,579      $1,886    $11,465      $  845    $12,310\\nEmployees\\' and directors\\' net vested\\n  and unvested stock options                         2,714         245      2,959         269      3,228\\n                                                   -------      ------    -------      ------    -------\\nEmployees\\' and directors\\' shares and options        12,293       2,131     14,424       1,114     15,538\\nOther investors\\' common shares                       9,486       3,930     13,416       4,259     17,675\\n                                                   -------      ------    -------      ------    -------\\n     Total                                         $21,779      $6,061    $27,840      $5,373    $33,213\\n                                                   =======      ======    =======      ======    =======\\n</TABLE>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       12\\n<PAGE>   14\\n\\n                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\nPrinciples of consolidation.  The financial statements include the accounts of\\nMicrosoft and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Significant intercompany\\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.\\n\\n         Foreign currencies.  Current assets and liabilities denominated in\\nforeign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet\\ndate.  Fixed assets and resulting depreciation are translated at historical\\nrates.  Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or\\ncredited to equity.  Revenues, costs, and expenses are translated at average\\nrates of exchange prevailing during the year.  Gains and losses on foreign\\ncurrency transactions are included in other expenses.\\n\\n         Revenue recognition.  Revenue from finished goods sales to\\ndistributors and resellers is recognized when related products are shipped.\\nRevenue billed upon shipment of finished goods products attributable to both\\nspecified and unspecified future product enhancements is deferred and\\nrecognized when such enhancements are delivered.  Revenue from software\\nmaintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period.\\n\\n         The Company warrants products against defects and has policies\\npermitting the return of products under certain circumstances.  Provision is\\nmade for warranty costs and returns.  Such costs generally have not been\\nmaterial.\\n\\n         Revenue from products licensed to original equipment manufacturers\\nis recognized when the licensed products are shipped by the OEM.  License fees\\nreceived prior to product acceptance are recorded as customer deposits.\\n\\n         Provision is made for bad debts.  Such costs generally have not been\\nmaterial.\\n\\n         Research and development.  Research and development costs are expensed\\nas incurred.\\n\\n         Income taxes.  Income tax expense includes U.S. and international\\nincome taxes, plus an accrual for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of\\ninternational subsidiaries.  Certain items of income and expense are not\\nreported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year.  The tax\\neffect of this difference is reported as deferred income taxes.  Tax credits\\nare accounted for as a reduction of tax expense in the year in which the\\ncredits reduce taxes payable.\\n\\n         Earnings per share.  Earnings per share is computed on the basis of\\nthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of\\noutstanding stock options, computed using the treasury stock method.\\n\\n         Stock split.  In May 1994, outstanding shares of common stock were\\nsplit two-for-one.  All shares and per share amounts have been restated.\\n\\n         Cash and short-term investments.  The Company considers all liquid\\ninvestments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to\\nbe cash equivalents.  Short-term investments are stated at the lower of cost or\\nmarket.  Cost approximates market value for all classifications of cash and\\nshort-term investments.\\n\\n         Inventories.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.\\nCost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.\\n\\n         Property, plant, and equipment.  Property, plant, and equipment is\\nstated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method.  Estimated lives\\nare as follows: buildings, 30 years; leasehold improvements, the lease term;\\ncomputer equipment and other, principally three years.\\n\\n         Diversification of risk.  The Company\\'s investment portfolio is\\ndiversified and consists of short-term investment grade securities.  At June\\n30, 1993 and 1994, approximately 40% of accounts receivable represented amounts\\ndue from ten channel purchasers.  Two of these each accounted for approximately\\n10% of revenues in 1993 and 13% in 1994.  The Company hedges certain foreign\\nexchange exposures although no material hedge contracts were outstanding at\\nJune 30, 1994.\\n\\n         Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS).  SFAS No. 86,\\nAccounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise\\nMarketed, does not materially affect the Company.  SFAS No. 109, Accounting for\\nIncome Taxes, was adopted in 1994, and the effect on current year and\\ncumulative net income was not material.  Required adoption of SFAS No. 115,\\nAccounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, in the first\\nquarter of 1995 will not have a material impact on the financial statements.\\nIn its current form, a proposed new SFAS, Accounting for Stock-based\\nCompensation, if adopted, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the\\nway future net income is reported.\\n\\n         Reclassifications.  Certain reclassifications have been made for\\nconsistent presentation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       13\\n<PAGE>   15\\n\\n                     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (cont.)\\n                                 (In millions)\\n\\n\\nCASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                  June 30\\n                                            --------------------\\n                                             1993          1994\\n                                            ------        ------\\n<S>                                         <C>           <C>\\nCash and equivalents:                                \\nCash                                        $  225        $  263\\nCommercial paper                               326           619\\nMoney market preferreds                        159           180\\nCertificates of deposit                        160           218\\nBank loan participations                       143           197\\n                                            ------        ------\\nCash and equivalents                         1,013         1,477\\n                                            ------        ------\\nShort-term investments:                              \\nMunicipal securities                           788         1,245\\nCorporate notes and bonds                      226           423\\nU.S. Treasury securities                       199           417\\nCommercial paper                                64            52\\n                                            ------        ------\\nShort-term investments                       1,277         2,137\\n                                            ------        ------\\nCash and short-term investments             $2,290        $3,614\\n                                            ======        ======\\n</TABLE>                                             \\n\\nPROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                  June 30\\n                                            --------------------\\n                                             1993          1994\\n                                            ------        ------\\n<S>                                         <C>           <C>\\nLand                                        $  144        $  162\\nBuildings                                      389           440\\nComputer equipment                             415           532\\nOther                                          233           311\\n                                            ------        ------\\nProperty, plant, and equipment -

Under the plan, participating\\nU.S. employees may defer up to 15% of their pretax salary, but not more than\\nstatutory limits.  The Company contributes fifty cents for each dollar\\ncontributed by a participant, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a\\nparticipant\\'s earnings.  The Company\\'s matching contributions to the savings\\nplan were $5 million, $7 million, and $9 million in 1992, 1993, and 1994.\\n\\n         Stock option plans.  The Company has stock option plans for directors,\\nofficers, and all employees, which provide for nonqualified and incentive stock\\noptions.  The Board of Directors determines the option price (not to be less\\nthan fair market value for incentive options) at the date of grant.  The\\noptions generally expire ten years from the date of grant and vest over four\\nand one-half years.

The European\\nCommission has the right to monitor Microsoft\\'s compliance during the 6-1/2\\nyear term of the settlement agreement.\\n\\n         On July 15, 1994, Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\\nentered into a consent decree resolving the DOJ\\'s nonpublic investigation of\\nMicrosoft.  The consent decree contained the same provisions as the undertaking\\nbetween Microsoft and the European Commission.  To become final, the consent\\ndecree must be approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of\\nColumbia.  The Court\\'s consideration of the consent decree and any comments and\\nresponses submitted concerning it will occur no sooner than 60 days after\\npublication of the consent decree in the Federal Register.\\n\\n         Microsoft does not expect the undertaking with the European Commission\\nor the consent decree with the DOJ to affect its OEM revenues.\\n\\n         On March 17, 1988, Apple Computer, Inc. (Apple) brought suit against\\nMicrosoft and Hewlett-Packard Company for alleged copyright infringement in the\\nU.S. District Court, Northern District of California.  The complaint included\\nallegations that the visual displays of Microsoft Windows version 2.03 (and\\nWindows version 3.0, which was added to the complaint later) infringed Apple\\'s\\ncopyrights and exceeded the scope of a 1985 Settlement Agreement between\\nMicrosoft and Apple.  The complaint sought to enjoin Microsoft from marketing\\nMicrosoft Windows versions 2.03 and 3.0 or any derivative work based on Windows\\n2.03 or 3.0 and from otherwise infringing Apple\\'s copyrights and sought damages\\nresulting from the alleged infringement.\\n\\n         The Company answered the complaint, raising affirmative defenses\\nincluding its claim that the 1985 Settlement Agreement entitled it to use the\\nvisual displays in question, denying Apple\\'s allegations that the visual\\ndisplays in Microsoft Windows version 2.03 and 3.0 infringe any protectible\\nright of Apple, and asserting counterclaims.\\n\\n         On August 24, 1993, the Court entered final judgment dismissing all of\\nApple\\'s claims.  Apple has appealed a number of the Court\\'s decisions in the\\ncase to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Microsoft has cross-appealed the\\ndismissal of one of its counterclaims and related issues.  Oral argument on the\\nappeal and cross-appeal was heard by Judges Ferdinand Fernandez, Pamela Rymer,\\nand Thomas Nelson on July 11, 1994.\\n\\n         On July 30, 1993 Wang Laboratories, Inc. (Wang) filed suit in U.S.\\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts against Microsoft and\\nWatermark Software, Inc., alleging that unspecified Microsoft products infringe\\ntwo patents owned by Wang concerning object management and the handling of\\ncompound documents (United States Patents 5,206,951 issued on April 27, 1993,\\nand 5,129,061 issued on July 7, 1992, respectively).  The suit also alleges\\nthat Microsoft induced and continues to induce others, including Watermark\\nSoftware, Inc., to infringe the Wang patents.  Microsoft\\'s OLE technology\\nappears to be the subject of Wang\\'s allegations against Microsoft.  The\\ncomplaint seeks a determination that Microsoft\\'s alleged infringement is\\nwillful, an award of treble damages, an award of attorneys\\' fees, and to\\npreliminarily and permanently enjoin Microsoft from continuing the alleged\\ninfringement.  In its answer Microsoft denied that any of its products infringe\\nthe Wang patents and asked the Court for a declaratory judgment that those\\npatents are invalid and unenforceable for failing to meet patent law\\nrequirements.  The suit is currently in the early stages of discovery.\\n\\n         Although there is no assurance that these lawsuits will be resolved\\nfavorably and that the Company\\'s financial condition will not be adversely\\naffected, the Company currently believes that resolution of these matters will\\nnot have material adverse effects on its financial condition as reported in the\\naccompanying financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       16\\n<PAGE>   18\\n\\n                     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (cont.)\\n                                 (In millions)\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                      1992             1993             1994\\n                                                     ------           ------           ------\\n<S>                                                  <C>              <C>              <C>\\nNET REVENUES\\n  U.S. operations                                    $1,878           $2,655           $3,472\\n  European operations                                 1,019            1,289            1,401\\n  Other international operations                        272              395              375\\n  Eliminations                                         (410)            (586)            (599)\\n                                                     ------           ------           ------\\n    Total net revenues                               $2,759           $3,753           $4,649\\n                                                     ======           ======           ======\\nOPERATING INCOME\\n  U.S. operations                                    $  664           $  961           $1,394\\n  European operations                                   329              360              346\\n  Other international operations                         11               18               31\\n  Eliminations                                           (8)             (13)             (45)\\n                                                     ------           ------           ------\\n    Total operating income                           $  996           $1,326           $1,726\\n                                                     ======           ======           ======\\nIDENTIFIABLE ASSETS\\n  U.S. operations                                    $1,858           $2,944           $4,397\\n  European operations                                   872            1,133            1,366\\n  Other international operations                        289              310              423\\n  Eliminations                                         (379)            (582)            (823)\\n                                                     ------           ------           ------\\n    Total identifiable assets                        $2,640           $3,805           $5,363\\n                                                     ======           ======           ======\\n</TABLE>\\n\\nIntercompany sales between geographic areas are accounted for at prices\\nrepresentative of unaffiliated party transactions.  \"U.S. operations\" include\\nshipments to customers in the U.S., licensing to OEMs, and exports of finished\\ngoods directly to international customers, primarily in Canada, South America,\\nand Asia.

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nsupporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit\\nalso includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant\\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial\\nstatement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\\nfor our opinion.\\n\\n         In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all \\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Microsoft Corporation and \\nsubsidiaries as of June 30, 1993 and 1994, and the results of their operations \\nand their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, \\n1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\\n\\n\\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE\\nSeattle, Washington\\nJuly 20, 1994\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       20\\n<PAGE>   22\\n\\n                                   Appendix A\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n PAGE WHERE\\n  GRAPHIC            DESCRIPTION OF GRAPHIC AND IMAGE MATERIAL\\n  APPEARS             (In millions, except earnings per share)\\n\\n<S>           <C>\\n 2            Bar graph of Net Revenues.\\n              Data points: 1992-$2,759, 1993-$3,753, 1994-$4,649\\n 2            Bar graph of Net Income.\\n              Data points: 1992-$708, 1993-$953, 1994-$1,146\\n 2            Bar graph of Earnings Per Share.\\n              Data points: 1992-$1.20, 1993-$1.57, 1994-$1.88\\n 3            Bar graph of Systems Revenues.\\n              Data points: 1992-$1,104, 1993-$1,267, 1994-$1,519\\n 3            Bar graph of Applications Revenues.\\n              Data points: 1992-$1,401, 1993-$2,253, 1994-$2,927\\n 4            Bar graph of U.S. and Canada Revenues.\\n              Data points: 1992-$1,062, 1993-$1,371, 1994-$1,575\\n 4            Bar graph of Europe Revenues.\\n              Data points: 1992-$997, 1993-$1,259, 1994-$1,363\\n 4            Bar graph of Other International Revenues.\\n              Data points: 1992-$223, 1993-$392, 1994-$532\\n 4            Bar graph of OEM Revenues.\\n              Data points: 1992-$477, 1993-$731, 1994-$1,179\\n 7            Bar graph of Research and Development Spending.\\n              Data points: 1992-$352, 1993-$470, 1994-$610\\n 7            Bar graph of Sales and Marketing Spending.\\n              Data points: 1992-$854, 1993-$1,205, 1994-$1,384\\n 8            Bar graph of Cash and Short-Term Investments\\n              Data points: 1992-$1,345, 1993-$2,290, 1994-$3,614\\n 9            Pie Chart of Assets - 1994.\\n              Data points: Cash-67%, Other Current Assets-13%, PP&E-18%, Other-2%\\n 9            Pie Chart of Liabilities and Stockholders\\' Equity - 1994.\\n              Data points: Liabilities-17%, Stockholders\\' Equity-83%\\n 10           Bar graph of Stockholders\\' Equity.\\n              Data points: 1992-$2,193, 1993-$3,242, 1994-$4,450\\n 11           Pie Chart of Stakeholdings - 1994.\\n              Data points: Other Investors\\' Shares-53%, Employees\\' and Directors\\' Shares and Options-47%\\n</TABLE>\\n</TEXT>\\n</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>\\n<TYPE>EX-21\\n<SEQUENCE>11\\n<DESCRIPTION>EXHIBIT 21\\n<TEXT>\\n\\n<PAGE>   1\\n\\n                                                                     EXHIBIT 21.\\n\\n                                  SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<S>                                                 <C>\\nCorporacionMicrosoft del Ecuador SA                 Microsoft Institute PTY Limited (Australian Educational Centre)\\nCorporation MS 90 de Venezuela SA                   Microsoft International BV (The Netherlands Holding Company)\\nDram Realty, Inc.

Participants\\nshould refer to the Plan agreement for a complete description of the Plan\\'s\\nprovisions.\\n\\n         GENERAL: The Plan Administrator believes the Plan meets the\\n         qualification standards of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of\\n         1986, and is exempt from federal income taxes.  The Plan is not\\n         subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security\\n         Act of 1974 (ERISA).\\n\\n         The Plan covers substantially all employees of Microsoft Corporation\\n         (the Company) whose customary employment is greater than 20 hours per\\n         week, and more than five months in any calendar year.\\n\\n         CONTRIBUTIONS:  Participants may make contributions to the Plan\\n         through payroll deductions (not exceeding 10% of their compensation)\\n         for the purpose of purchasing the Company\\'s common stock.  The Plan\\n         commenced on January 1, 1991, and participants are given the\\n         opportunity to purchase shares on each June 30 and December 31 until\\n         such time as the Plan is terminated (see Termination of the Plan).\\n         The maximum number of shares that will be offered under the Plan is\\n         6,750,000.\\n\\n         OPTIONS GRANTED AND WITHDRAWALS:  Participants are granted the option\\n         to purchase shares of Microsoft Corporation common stock from the\\n         Company at 85% of the lesser of the fair market value on the first or\\n         last day of each six-month period ending June 30 or December 31.  If\\n         the participant does not exercise the option, the Company refunds the\\n         participant for amounts withheld. The Plan purchased 1,147,508,\\n         1,006,988, and 940,140 shares during the years ended June 30, 1994,\\n         1993, and 1992, respectively.  A total of 3,636,422 shares have been\\n         purchased under the Plan since inception with 3,113,578 shares\\n         reserved for future issue.\\n\\n         ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITS:  Assets available for benefits\\n         represent cash in participant accounts that was less than the amount\\n         necessary to purchase a full share and cash contributed to the Plan\\n         greater than the cost of the maximum number of shares allowed to be\\n         purchased in a six-month period (see Limitations). Participants may \\n         carry over such amounts to the next period.\\n\\n         LIMITATIONS:  No employee shall be permitted to subscribe for any\\n         shares under the Plan if such employee owns shares representing 5% or\\n         more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of\\n         shares of the Company.  Additionally, no participant may purchase more\\n         than 2,250 shares of stock during a six-month period, or purchase\\n         shares through the Plan with an aggregate fair market value in excess\\n         of $25,000 in any one calendar year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<PAGE>   6\\n         TERMINATION OF THE PLAN:  The Plan shall terminate at the earliest of\\nthe following:\\n\\n         o       December 31, 1996\\n\\n         o       The date of the filing of a statement of intent to dissolve by\\n                 the Company or the effective date of a merger or consolidation\\n                 (except with a related company) where the Company is not to be\\n                 the surviving corporation\\n\\n         o       The date the Board acts to terminate the Plan\\n\\n         o       The date when all shares reserved under the Plan have been\\n                 purchased\\n\\n         In the event of a dissolution, merger, or acquisition, the Company may\\n         permit a participating employee to exercise options to the extent that\\n         employee payroll deductions have accumulated. In the event of\\n         termination, Plan assets will be distributed to the participants.\\n\\n         PLAN ADMINISTRATION:  All expenses for administration of the Plan are\\n         paid by the Company, and are not reflected in the accompanying\\n         statements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</TEXT>\\n</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>\\n<TYPE>EX-99.2\\n<SEQUENCE>15\\n<DESCRIPTION>EXHIBIT 99.2\\n<TEXT>\\n\\n<PAGE>   1\\n\\n                                                                   EXHIBIT 99.2\\n                                                                               \\n                             MICROSOFT CORPORATION\\n                               SAVINGS PLUS PLAN\\n\\n           Financial Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 1993\\n                  and the Nine Months Ended December 31, 1992\\n                        And Independent Auditors\\' Report\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<PAGE>   2\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS\\' REPORT\\n\\nPlan Administrator\\nMicrosoft Corporation Savings Plus Plan\\nRedmond, Washington\\n\\nWe have audited the accompanying statements of assets available for benefits of\\nthe Microsoft Corporation Savings Plus Plan (the Plan) as of December 31, 1993\\nand 1992, and the related statements of changes in assets available for\\nbenefits for the year ended December 31, 1993, and the nine-month period ended\\nDecember 31, 1992.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN AND\\n         SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\nThe following description of the Microsoft Corporation Savings Plus Plan (the\\nPlan) provides only general information.  Participants should refer to the Plan\\nagreement for a complete description of the Plan\\'s provisions.\\n\\n         PLAN DESCRIPTION:  The Plan is a defined contribution plan.  All\\n         employees of Microsoft Corporation (the Company) who have reached 18\\n         years of age may enroll during the month following completion of six\\n         months of service or during any subsequent quarterly enrollment\\n         period.  The Plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee\\n         Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  The Plan has obtained a\\n         determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service which stated\\n         the Plan was in compliance with the applicable requirements of the\\n         Internal Revenue Code.  The Plan is administered by the Vice President\\n         of Finance and Administration of Microsoft Corporation.  The Plan\\n         Administrator believes the Plan is currently designed and is being\\n         operated in compliance with the applicable regulations.\\n\\n         CONTRIBUTIONS:  Participants may contribute from 1% to 15% of their\\n         compensation, tax-deferred, through payroll deductions up to a maximum\\n         of $8,994 under current law.  The amount of a participant\\'s\\n         tax-deferred contributions may be subject to limitations.  Participant\\n         contributions may be suspended at any time.  Contributions may be\\n         reinstated on the first day of the quarter that is at least six months\\n         after contributions were suspended.\\n\\n         The Company makes a matching contribution equal to 50% of\\n         participants\\' contributions up to 6% of participants\\' individual\\n         compensation.  Company contributions are funded on a semimonthly\\n         basis.\\n\\n         VESTING:  Employee contributions are fully vested immediately.\\n         Employer contributions vest fully upon completion of two years of\\n         service by a participant, or when a participant reaches age 65, dies,\\n         or becomes disabled.\\n\\n         DISTRIBUTIONS:  Participants may make a withdrawal from the vested\\n         portion of their account if the Plan Administrator determines a\\n         withdrawal is necessary to avoid a financial hardship or if the\\n         participant is at least 59-1/2 years of age.\\n\\n         FORFEITURES:  Any nonvested interest of a terminated employee shall\\n         not be forfeited to the Plan until a one-year period of severance\\n         service has passed.  At this time, the forfeited amount is distributed\\n         to the Plan.  If a terminated employee is reemployed before five\\n         consecutive one-year periods of severance have passed, the forfeited\\n         amount will be reallocated to the individual\\'s account.\\n\\n         ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:  Expenses for administration of the Plan are\\n         paid by the Company.\\n\\n         PLAN AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION:  The Company has the right to modify,\\n         amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason.\\n         If the Plan is terminated, account balances will be fully vested and\\n         will be distributed in the form and manner determined by the Plan\\n         Administrator.\\n\\n         VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS AND PARTICIPANTS\\' LOANS:  Investments are\\n         recorded at fair market value.  Security transactions are accounted\\n         for as of the trade date.  Fair market value is estimated based on\\n         quoted prices.  Loans to participants are recorded at contract value,\\n         which approximates fair value.  Dividend income is recorded on the\\n         ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded as earned.\\n\\n\\n<PAGE>   6\\n\\nNOTE 2:  INVESTMENTS\\n\\nFidelity Investments (Fidelity) is trustee of the Plan.

customers that represent more than 10 of the companys revenues the companys practice is to ship its products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from its customers and consequently backlog is not significant product development the microcomputer software industry is characterized by rapid technological change which requires a continuous high level of expenditures for enhancing existing products and developing new products the company is committed to continued expenditures for research and product development most of the companys software products are developed internally the company also purchases technology licenses intellectual property rights and oversees third party development for certain products product documentation is also created internally internal development enables microsoft to maintain closer technical control over the products and gives the company the freedom to designate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented the company has created a substantial body of proprietary development tools and has evolved a development methodology for creating and enhancing its products these tools and methodology are also designed to simplify a products portability among different operating systems or computers the company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is getting it to market quickly to respond to a new user need or an advance in hardware design without compromising product quality the company strives to become as informed as possible at the earliest possible time about technological advances and changing usage patterns during fiscal years 1992 1993 and 1994 the company spent 352 million 470 million and 610 million respectively on product research and development

change the companys competitors include many independent software vendors such as lotus development oracle and novell these companies generally have a narrower focus than the company in product offerings such as spreadsheets relational databases word processors and networking software large personal computer oems are devoting significant resources to creating operating systems notably ibm apple computer and sun microsystems microsoft markets its operating systems products to oems and end users the company competes for that business with the large oems and joint ventures of oems and independent systems software vendors such as novell the company believes that the principal competitive factors in marketing microcomputer software are the products reputation features and functions ease of use reliability price relative to performance timeliness of delivery and availability and quality of support services there is no assurance that the companys competitive position will not be adversely affected by one or more of these factors in the future see outlook issues and risks on page 6 of the 1994 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated herein by reference 8 11 product protection microsoft regards the intellectual property used in its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it with copyrights patents trade secret laws internal and external nondisclosure safeguards and restrictions on disclosure and transfer that are incorporated into its software license agreements despite these restrictions it is possible for competitors and users to copy aspects of the companys products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary existing laws protecting intellectual property are helpful but imperfect aids in preventing unauthorized copying and use of the companys products monitoring and identifying unauthorized copying and use of software can be difficult and software piracy is a persistent problem for the software industry piracy is particularly acute in international markets some of the companys products distributed internationally use electronic copy protection to assist in preventing unauthorized copies but the more typical company antipiracy strategy is to work with others in the industry to secure the passage of appropriate laws protecting software to educate the market and persuade users about the benefits of legitimate software and to participate in selective enforcement actions manufacturing the company has manufacturing facilities located in the united states puerto rico and ireland the companys

revenues were 223 million in 1992 and 392 million in 1993 the companys operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates approximately 46 44 and 40 of the companys revenues were collected in foreign currencies during 1992 1993 and 1994 since much of the companys international manufacturing costs and operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies the relative impact of exchange rates on net income is less than on revenues oem revenues grew 61 from the prior year to 1179 million oem revenues were 477 million in 1992 and 731 million in 1993 the primary source of oem revenues

90 32 119 39 166 percentage of net revenues 33 32 36 increases in research and development expenses resulted primarily from planned additions to the companys software development and advanced technology staffs as well as higher levels of thirdparty development costs in 1994 sales and marketing expenses increased at a slower rate than revenues due to a concerted performance orientation at all sales sites the increases in the absolute dollars of sales and marketing expenses in 1993 and 1994 were due to increased marketing programs and advertising for the launch of new products planned hiring of marketing personnel and continued development of product support services increases in general and administrative expenses are primarily attributable to higher legal costs and growth in the systems and people necessary to support overall increases in the scope of the companys operations nonoperating income 1992 change 1993 change 1994 nonoperating income 45 67 75 15 86 litigation charge

portfolio generated by cash from operations offset in both 1993 and 1994 by declining interest rates in the third quarter of 1994 the company recorded a 120 million charge to reflect the estimated impact of a jury verdict in the stac electronics patent litigation and related expenses in june 1994 the company reached an agreement with stac to settle the litigation and adjusted its estimate

expenditures 5 7 managements discussion and analysis cont outlook issues and risks the companys 1994 annual report includes discussions of its longterm growth outlook the following issues and risks among others should also be considered in evaluating its outlook rapid technological change the personal computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological change and uncertainty as to the widespread acceptance of new products longterm investment cycle developing manufacturing and licensing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long payback cycle the company began investing in the principal products that are significant to its current revenues in the early 1980s the companys plans for 1995 include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities from which significant revenues are not anticipated for a number of years product ship schedules delays in the release of new products can cause operational inefficiencies that impact manufacturing capabilities distribution logistics and telephone support staffing microsoft office revenues from microsoft office may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 1995 the price of microsoft office is less than the sum of the prices for the individual application programs included in this product when such programs are sold separately prices future prices the company is able to obtain for its products may decrease from historical levels depending upon market or other cost factors saturation product upgrades enabling users to upgrade from earlier versions of the companys products or from competitors products have lower prices than new products as the desktop pc software market becomes saturated the sales mix shifts from standard products to upgrade products this trend is expected to continue in 1995 introductory pricing the company has offered certain new products at low introductory prices this practice may continue with other new product offerings channel mix average revenue per license is lower from oem licenses than from retail versions reflecting the relatively lower direct costs of operations in the oem channel an increasingly higher percentage of revenues was achieved through the oem channel during 1993 and 1994 volume discounts in 1994 unit sales increased under microsoft select a large account program designed to permit large organizations to license microsoft products average revenue per copy from select license programs is lower than average revenue per copy from retail versions shipped through the finished goods channels foreign exchange a large percentage of the companys sales are transacted in local currencies as a result the companys revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations cost of revenues although cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues was relatively consistent in 1993 and 1994 it varies with channel mix and product mix within channels changes in channel and product mix as well as in the cost of product components may affect cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in 1995 sales and marketing and support investments the companys plans for 1995 include continued investments in its sales and marketing and support groups competitors may be able to enter the market without making investments of such scale accounting standards accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board change periodically changes in such standards including currently proposed changes in the accounting for employee stock option plans may have a negative impact on the companys future reported earnings unlicensed copying unlicensed copying of software represents a loss of revenues to the company the company is actively educating consumers and lawmakers on this issue however there can be no assurance that continued efforts will affect revenues positively growth rates management believes the companys recent revenue growth rates are not sustainable operating expenses as a percentage of revenues may increase in 1995 because of the above factors among others 6 8 managements discussion and analysis cont in

appropriate accounting for stock options questions in this ongoing discussion include how stock options should be measured whether they should be recorded in traditional financial statements subject
