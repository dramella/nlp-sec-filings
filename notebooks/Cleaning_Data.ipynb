times the projected rate lockdown periods economic uncertainty and loss of predictability have forced customers and businesses online in previously unseen numbers this migration has upset the power balance with customers now more in control of the relationship and less loyal to brands and products on top of that 60 of companies have seen new buying behaviors such as changes to average basket size and product interests pandemic disruption is also causing many businesses to demand a similar level of convenience to consumers when we return to normal there is no question that the new normal will be digital growth in investor awareness and outreach we expect that in 2023 the strategic outreach will be directed at investors around the world who understand the digital marketplace and its expanding influence on consumer decisions dbmm will target new investors through a global digital and traditional integrated investor outreach campaign which will be run by digital clarity with third parties as required for distribution in all areas the company will act in the interests of all stakeholders 25 in the full industry context of dramatic expansion of digital footprints there has been no direct correlation between dbmms revenues and its share price economic and industry analysts have opined that the industry multiple continues to grow to in some cases 2530 times revenues dbmm will expand its client and geographic scale thus increasing revenues there were matters outside of dbmms control which caused growth to be in neutral and in 202021 the pandemic threw all planning into disarray with capital infusion following the closure of the sec review with a final order of the earlier dismissal 2023 will follow the model of a growing client base and geographic reach until it achieves a tbd level of profitability we anticipate the benchmark will replicate successful industry models in digital technology marketing and company transformation on october 26 2022 finra processed a form 211 relating to the initiation of priced quotations of our shares of common stock which means that the submitting brokerdealer has demonstrated to finra compliance with finra rule 6432 and therefore has met the requirements under that rule to initiate a quotation for our shares of common stock within four days of october 26 2022 finras processing of a form 211 in no way constitutes finras approval of the security the issuer or the issuers business and relates solely to the submitting brokerdealers obligation to comply with finra rule 6432 and sea rule 15c211 when quoting a security finra to glendale securities after otc markets review of our activities following their process our shares of common stock returned to normal market trading without restriction or caveat emptor the caveat emptor was removed on december 20 2022 accordingly plans to grow investor awareness and outreach are underway glendale securities inc is the designated market maker the sec matter has remained open since the november 12 2019 dismissal regarding the cured late filings this is damaging to our investors and us and impedes our progress our compliance continues with required timely filings and we hope the matter is closed shortly financial overviewoutlook dbmm has been honing its commercial model since the acquisition of digital clarity dc in 2011 and has been cash flowpositive as an operating company since then unfortunately external events outside of dbmms control have precluded the growth expected to this point however its margins of 3550 are accurate aspirationally when the company reaches appropriate scale and profitability tbd the business will meet all stakeholder expectations the growth trajectory anticipated during 2023 remained deferred until the company returns to normal business and normal trading normal trading has resumed and the clients will benefit immediately due to a wider range of resources and the shareholders will benefit as the market cap grows the media market multiple far exceeds the old manufacturing multiples as digital technology and marketing has become one of fastest growing industries in the world today the trading in our shares of common stock returned to normal on december 20 2022 with no restrictions the us retail marketplace of our shares of common stock was open finally to all investors dbmms place in the industry reputationally is strong particularly for its size the industry environment continues to grow exponentially and digital marketing and company transformation is an essential strategy for any commercial activity and thus has become embedded in planning since 2020 revenues have slowed down temporarily due to a number of factors 1 client uncertainty caused by brexit trade issues 2 covid19 global slowdown with some clients pausing as lockdowns stopped and started 3 clients needing to extend or double down lacked the resources to address the changing environment the business development model has evolved and as such digital clarity has earned a seat at the table client by client with precision the revenues are turning around several years ago the company received a commitment for future working capital to grow the company in key markets growth capital will be directed to support a client base rebalancing and leveraging of a very dynamic transformational digital landscape dcs mantra remains the same roi is our dna going forward there will be an emphasis on investor awareness as soon as normal business has recommenced dbmm intends to make significant strides in aggressively broadening its brand exposure there are investors around the globe who understand the digital marketplace and its increasing influence on commercial decisions dbmm will be targeting new shareholders in the public market through a global digital and traditional integrated campaign run by dc with third parties as required for distribution the expectations for fiscal year 2023 was to return to normal trading first which now has occurred and then move ahead to a scaled growth plan in multiple geographies once normal business recommences and the sec matter is closed the result will benefit all stakeholders the company resolved in 2015 to eliminate any consideration of using convertible debentures as a financing vehicle accordingly the company has not issued convertible debentures since 2015 26 additionally we have demonstrated our adherence to such a philosophy by renegotiating its aged debt with lenders one at a time at fixed settlement amounts with no conversion terms furthermore such renegotiations lead to the derecognition of derivative liabilities overhanging our balance sheet the company intends to continue its debt negotiation and modification program this has been a successful strategy thus far during fiscal year 2021 and so far in 2023 and to a lesser extent in fiscal 2020 we successfully reached agreements with certain lenders resulting in a
