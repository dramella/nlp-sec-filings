and advertising shelter marketplace it is made up of a smaller amount of direct competitors including jc decaux lamar clear chanel signal outdoor and various others we believe the shelter marketplace and the new areas in other green energy marketplace may be subject to more technological change given this we believe that the major competitive factors in our marketplace are distinctive technical competencies governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space successful past contract performance price of services reputation for quality and key management personnel with domain expertise marketing and sales we currently engage in a limited amount of marketing activities related to request for proposals for projects related to government contracts and or other contracting activities with commercial and private entities we are developing a variety of new marketing activities designed to broaden our market awareness of our products services and solutions that

energy business clients our client base is presently made up predominately of yous based national advertisers historically we have derived and may continue to derive in the future a significant percentage of our total revenues from a relatively small number of contracts due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts which are entered into in the ordinary course of business the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the number of our customer contracts and seeking out partnerships that will allow us to increase our customer reach intellectual property our intellectual property rights are important to our business we believe we will come to rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark service mark trade secret and other rights in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property we will protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees customers consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary technology and other information despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights third parties may in an unauthorized manner attempt to use copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology yous patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making using selling or importing in the united states the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents our patents including our pending patents if granted may be contested circumvented or invalidated moreover the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents therefore the exact benefits of our issued patents and if issued our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty on

commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter as well as the schedule of government agencies awarding contracts the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions because a portion of our expenses such as personnel and facilities costs are fixed in the short term successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well

judgments including those described in greater detail below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates

policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements those material accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical to an investors understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed immediately below and are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment assessments related to longlived assets consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned and lessthanwholly owned subsidiaries of which the company holds a controlling interest all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts attributable to minority interests in the companys lessthanwholly owned subsidiary are presented as noncontrolling interest on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and shortterm liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic provided insurance coverage of up to 250000 per depositor per institution at december 31 2022 and 2021 none of the companys cash balances were in excess of federally insured limits any and all withdrawals are strictly controlled by the lending institution and use of proceeds must be approved prior to release of funds accounts receivable in the normal course of business we decide to extend credit to certain customers without requiring collateral or other security interests management reviews its accounts receivable at each reporting period to provide for an allowance against accounts receivable for an amount that could become uncollectible this review process may involve the identification of payment problems with specific customers periodically we estimate this allowance based on the aging of the accounts receivable historical collection experience and other relevant factors such as changes in the economy and the imposition of regulatory requirements that can have an impact on the industry these factors continuously change and can have an impact on collections and our estimation process the company determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts was not necessary as of december 31 2022 and 2021 leases in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 topic 842 topic 842 amends several aspects of lease accounting including requiring lessees to recognize leases with a term greater than one year as a rightofuse asset and corresponding liability measured at the present value of the lease payments in july 2018 the fasb issued supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to topic 842 within asu 201810 codification improvements to topic 842 leases and asu 201811 leases topic 842 targeted improvements the new guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements a modified retrospective application is required with an option to not restate comparative periods in the period of adoption the company effective january 1 2019 has adopted the provisions of the new standard the company has operating leases for warehouses and offices management evaluates each lease independently to determine the purpose necessity to its future operations in addition to other appropriate facts and circumstances we adopted topic 842 using a modified retrospective approach for all existing leases at january 1 2019 the adoption of topic 842 impacted our balance sheet by the recognition of the operating lease rightofuse assets and the liability for operating leases accordingly upon adoption leases that were classified as operating leases under the previous guidance were classified as operating leases under topic 842 the lease liability is based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using a market based incremental borrowing rate as the effective date of january 1 2019 using current estimates as to lease term including estimated renewals for each operating lease as of january 1 2019 the company recorded an adjustment of approximately 1339000 to operating lease rightofuse assets rou and the related lease liability note 7 contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date financial statements are issued which may result in a loss but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or do not occur we assess such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to pending legal proceedings that are pending against us or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings we evaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in our consolidated financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable would be disclosed fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of the companys accounts receivable accounts payable accrued expenses and accrued expenses due to related parties approximate fair value due to their shortterm nature the companys longterm debt approximates fair value given the instruments bear market rates of interest property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost additions and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the life of an asset are capitalized maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred depreciation is computed using the straightline method over three to five years for vehicles and five to ten years for equipment leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated remaining useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term impairment of longlived assets the company periodically reviews for the impairment of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be realizable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount at december 31 2022 and 2021 the company has not identified any such impairment losses income taxes under asc topic 740 income taxes the company is required to account for its income taxes through the establishment of a deferred tax asset or liability for the recognition of future deductible or taxable amounts and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax expense or benefit is recognized as a result of timing differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes during the year deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating losses and tax credit carry forwards a valuation allowance is established to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer in accordance with topic 606 revenue from the sale of advertising space on displays from the companys outdoor advertising shelter revenues is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract as the advertisement is displayed the company recognizes revenue in amounts that reflect the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to customers excluding sales taxes and other similar taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities the transaction price when this consideration includes a variable amount the company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to receive and only recognizes revenue to the extent that it is probable it will not be reversed in a future reporting period because the transfer of promised goods and services to the customer is generally within a year of scheduled payment from the customer the company is not typically required to consider the effects of the time value of money when determining the transaction price advertising revenue is reported net of agency commissions in order to appropriately identify the unit of accounting for revenue recognition the company determines which promised goods and services in a contract with a customer are distinct and are therefore separate performance obligations if a promised good or service does not meet the criteria to be considered distinct it is combined with other promised goods or services until a distinct bundle of goods or services exists for revenue arrangements that contain multiple distinct goods or services the company allocates the transaction price to these performance obligations in proportion to their relative standalone selling prices the company has concluded that the contractual prices for the promised goods and services in its standard contracts generally approximate managements best estimate of standalone selling price as the rates reflect various factors such as the size and characteristics of the target audience market location and size and recent market selling prices however where the company provides customers with free or discounted services as part of contract negotiations management uses judgment to determine how much of the transaction price to allocate to these performance obligations the company receives payments from customers based on billing schedules that are established in its contracts and deferred revenue is recorded when payment is received from a customer before the company has satisfied the performance obligation or a noncancelable contract has been billed in advance in accordance with the companys normal billing terms all of the companys revenue for the years ended december 31 2022 and 2021 is recognized based on the companys satisfaction of distinct performance obligations identified in each agreement generally at a point in time as defined by topic 606 as amended in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers this standard replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance and is codified in fasb asc topic 606 effective january 1 2018 the company adopted asu no 201409 using the modified retrospective method under the new guidance the company recognizes revenue from contracts based on the companys satisfaction of distinct performance obligations identified in each agreement the adoption of the guidance under asu no 201409 did not result in a material impact on the companys consolidated revenues results of operations or financial position as part of the implementation of asc 606 the company must present disaggregation of revenues from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors quantitative disclosures on the disaggregation of revenue are as follows earnings per share under asc 260 earnings per share eps the company provides for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share basic eps includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted eps reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings or losses of the entity for the year ended december 31 2022 basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the calculation of diluted per share amounts would result in an antidilutive calculation the following summarizes the calculation of diluted income per share for the year ended december 31 2021 results of operations for the year ended december 31 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31 2021 revenues during the year ended december 31 2022 revenues decreased 112020 from 377593 for the year ended december 31 2021 to 265573 in 2022 as a result of more advertising revenues and less general contracting services as the company migrates away from general contracting services and towards the development of green energy projects including the sale of solar powered shelters and other energy related projects that derive income from advertising sources the company has entered into revenue sharing agreements with the city of tallahassee and the state of new jersey along with others depending upon the timing of installation and advertising revenue generated per shelter and or other advertisingbased product the companys revenue may increase materially from this green energy offering cost of revenues during the year ended december 31 2022 cost of revenues decreased by 10401 from 27044 for the year ended december 31 2021 to 16643 in 2022 as a result of less general contracting services revenues costs of revenues may shift dramatically depending upon how the companys comparative revenue profile of the products and services shift in the future operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2022 operating expenses increased by 95248 from 441311 for the year ended december 31 2021 to 536559 in need to disclose the reason for the

and unbilled receivables at december 31 2022 we had a net working capital deficit of approximately 3120589 compared to 2883433 at december 31 2021 we intend to seek additional financing for our working capital in the form of equity or debt to provide us with the necessary capital to accomplish our plan of operation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital during the years ended december 31 2022 and 2021 we received 0 and 35905 respectively from the payroll protection program generally the company has insufficient capital to maintain operations cashflows from operations of the company and all its subsidiary holdings will not sustain the companys operations let alone its filing requirements unless there is substantial influx of cash flow through either debt andor equity financing cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities provides an indication of our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our recurring business activities fixed costs such as labor direct materials and office rent represent a significant portion of the companys continuing operating costs for the year ended december

payroll protection program in the short term we must raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to support our business operations and grow our business over the long term we must successfully execute our growth plans to increase profitable revenue and income streams to generate positive cash flows to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth initiatives or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external sources to meet minimum operating requirements we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet financing arrangements contractual obligations not required of smaller

provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and changes in financial condition you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements of shapeways included in this report and the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended december 31 2022 which is contained in our annual report on form 10ka filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on august 4 2023 some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see special note regarding forwardlooking statements and risk factors for a discussion of forwardlooking statements and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements except as required by law we do not intend to update any of these forwardlooking statements after the date hereof or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations company overview shapeways is a leading digital manufacturer combining high quality flexible ondemand manufacturing with purposebuilt proprietary software to offer customers an endtoend digital manufacturing platform on which they can rapidly transform digital designs into physical products our manufacturing platform offers customers access to high quality manufacturing from start to finish through automation innovation and digitization our proprietary software wide selection of materials and technologies and global supply chain lower manufacturing barriers and accelerate delivery of manufactured parts from prototypes to finished end parts we combine deep digital manufacturing knowhow and software expertise to deliver high quality flexible ondemand digital manufacturing to a range of customers from projectfocused engineers to large enterprises digital manufacturing is the complete digitization of the endtoend manufacturing process that enables the transition of a digital file to a physical product key factors affecting operating results we believe that our performance and future success depend on many factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges including the following commercial launch of offerings we plan to continue to launch new manufacturing technologies materials and finishes prior to commercialization we must complete testing and manufacturing rampup either in house or through our network of thirdparty manufacturing partners any delays in the successful completion of these steps or the results of testing may impact our ability or the pace at which we will generate revenue from these offerings even if we successfully introduce these new offerings there is no assurance that they will be accepted by the broader market in april 2022 we acquired mfgcom mfg and makeros inc makeros which we believe will help further our software strategy and are expected to help accelerate the phased rollout of our software offering otto we believe that offering our otto software to other manufacturers will enable us to generate future revenue we expect to further commercialize our software which we expect will provide software customers with an endtoend software for their manufacturing operations and expand the manufacturing capabilities that they offer to their customers we have seen an increase in revenues from sales of our software to date however it may never scale to our expectations in july 2023 we announced the launch of a 3d model viewer for our software offering deployed via the mfg brand this feature is available for manufacturers on the mfgcom platform and is intended to accelerate and improve the quoting process the 3d model viewer provides manufacturers with a unified platform and the latest technology for viewing 3d models of custom parts which streamlines the quoting process and allows for greater accuracy and speed in addition to providing multiple benefits for manufacturers the enhanced 3d capability also streamlines the purchasing experience for buyers because they can receive faster more precise quotes 33 table of contents in august 2023 we announced a further expansion of our software offerings with the launch of mfg materials this new service provides a range of raw materials to manufacturers at discounted rates reinforcing our role as a comprehensive partner in the manufacturing sector through our mfg brand through strategic partnerships and negotiations with toptier raw materials vendors we provide discounted rates from list prices on the mfg materials platform which vary based on material and quantity ordered adoption of our digital manufacturing solutions we believe that the market is shifting toward digitization of manufacturing and approaching an inflection point in the overall adoption of digital manufacturing solutions we believe that we are wellpositioned to take advantage of this market opportunity across an array of industries due to our platform that combines highquality flexible ondemand manufacturing with purposebuilt proprietary software we expect that our results of operations including revenue and gross margins will fluctuate for the foreseeable future as businesses continue to shift away from traditional manufacturing processes towards digital manufacturing the degree to which current and potential customers recognize the benefits of the digitization of manufacturing and then use our solutions in particular will affect our financial results pricing product cost and margins to date the majority of our revenue has been generated by the manufacturing and sales of additivelymanufactured end parts software and manufacturing pricing may vary due to marketspecific supply and demand dynamics customer order size and other factors sales of certain products such as software have or are expected to have higher gross margins than others as a result our financial performance depends in part on the mix of offerings we sell during a given period our financial performance could also be affected by our level of acquisition activity and the timing of any such transactions and could impact the amount of additional revenue we receive in a particular period as well as gross margins and operating expenses in addition we are subject to price competition and our ability to compete in key markets will depend on the success of our investments in our offerings and on cost improvements as well as on our ability to efficiently and reliably introduce costeffective digital manufacturing solutions for our customers continued investment and innovation we believe that we are a leader in digital manufacturing solutions offering highquality flexible ondemand manufacturing coupled with purposebuilt proprietary software our performance is significantly dependent on the investment we make in our software development efforts and in new digital manufacturing technologies it is essential that we continually identify and respond to rapidly evolving customer requirements develop and introduce innovative new offerings enhance existing solutions and generate customer demand for our offerings we believe that investment in our digital manufacturing solutions will contribute to longterm revenue growth but depending on the level of such investment may adversely affect nearterm profitability we have also invested and plan to continue to invest in increasing our customer focus on middle market and enterprise opportunities including by hiring business development personnel we believe we will start to benefit from these investments in the coming quarters but we expect to continue experiencing nearterm impact on our gross margins as we continue to invest in this strategy our customer count may continue to decline as we increase our focus on middle market and enterprise opportunities additionally these businesses involve risks that may not be present with smaller customers including longer sales cycles which create difficulties in assessing deal cyclicality and may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly in future periods 34 table of contents raw material inflation and supply chain trends inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of raw materials packaging materials purchased product energy costs shipping costs and labor costs affect our operating results and financial condition the ongoing impact of the russian invasion of ukraine the potential impacts of the israelhamas conflict geopolitical tensions between the unites states and china a potential yous government shutdown and other supply and labor disruptions along with inflationary or recessionary factors could have a material impact on our future costs and thus a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the future although we make efforts to minimize the impact of inflationary factors which may include raising prices to our customers in the future a high rate of pricing volatility associated with raw materials used in our products may have an adverse effect on our operating results we will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers leveraging our global capabilities and expertise to work through supply and other resulting issues components of results of operations revenue the majority of our

determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america yous gaap we believe that adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our operational performance we use this nongaap financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes we believe that this nongaap financial information when reviewed collectively with our yous gaap results may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding interest expense net of interest income income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense change in fair value of warrant liabilities change in fair value of earnout liabilities acquisition costs restructuring costs impairment costs writeoffs and other which includes other income and nonoperating gains and losses we believe that the use of adjusted ebitda provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends because it eliminates the effect of financing and capital expenditures and provides investors with a means to compare our financial measures with those of comparable companies which may present similar nongaap financial measures to investors however you should be aware that when evaluating adjusted ebitda we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating this measure in addition our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with yous gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our yous gaap results and using adjusted ebitda on a supplemental basis you should review the reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 40 table of contents the following table reconciles net loss to adjusted ebitda for the three and nine months ended september 30 2023 and 2022 liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses from operations in each of our annual reporting periods since our inception and as of september 30 2023 we had an accumulated deficit of 1664 million we had net losses of 334 million and 133 million for the nine months ended september 30 2023 and 2022 respectively we believe we may continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flow in the future in accordance with accounting standards update 201415 asc topic 20540 presentation of financial statements going concern disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern we are required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period including interim periods management considered our current projections of future cash flows current financial condition and sources of liquidity for at least one year from the issuance date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report in considering whether we have the ability to meet our obligations as of september 30 2023 we had 175 million in cash and cash equivalents 01 million in restricted cash and negative cash flows of 131 million these conditions among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these financial statements our primary use of cash is to fund our operations cash used to fund operating expenses is affected by the timing of when we pay expenses as reflected in the change in our working capital items management initiated a number of cost reduction measures in the quarter ended september 30 2023 including a reduction in force completed in october 2023 reduction of new hires and reduction in noncritical capital and discretionary operating expenditures we have also identified several further potential actions that could be initiated in a timely manner to extend the cash runway necessary to fund operations and to address our liquidity needs over the twelvemonth period from the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report these actions include raising substantial additional capital to fund our operations through equity or debt financings or other sources strategic collaborations deferral and reprioritization of certain additional research and development programs that would involve reduced program and headcount spend further reduction in force realignment of operating infrastructure including closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities and further reduction in noncritical capital and discretionary operating expenditures including personnel costs travel and recruitment additional equipment and business support spend although we are continuing to explore actions to maximize shareholder value and management has taken actions to reduce cash use we cannot be sure these actions will sufficiently reduce or eliminate future losses furthermore we have been working with advisors to consider strategic alternatives potential strategic alternatives may include without limitation a sale of a material portion of assets merger business combination or other strategic 41 table of contents transaction we have not made a decision to pursue or not pursue any particular strategic alternative and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction on october 6 2022 we filed a universal shelf registration statement which permits us

services received and placed purchase orders for another 36 million of equipment materials and services to be purchased under the mou we have no further obligations under the mou the timing of

may be required to evaluate additional alternatives in restructuring our business and our capital structure any failure in these efforts could force us to delay limit or terminate our operations make
