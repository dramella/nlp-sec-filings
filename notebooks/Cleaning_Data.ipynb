platform and using any device when sending payments or getting paid including persontoperson payments regulatory environment we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry including countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy cybersecurity and consumer protection the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation new or changing laws and regulations including changes to their interpretation and implementation as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition we monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers 33 table

processes designed to protect the data we manage prevent data loss and other security incidents and effectively respond to known and potential risks and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections we remain subject to these risks and there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient security or prevent breaches or attacks for

employee community impacted by these events we continue to take actions to comply with all applicable restrictions and sanctions that may impact our operations in march 2022 we suspended our

within the scope of its passport permissions as they stood at the end of the transition period under the temporary permissions regime pending the grant of new youk authorizations by the youk financial regulators we are currently unable to determine the longerterm impact that160brexit160will have on our business which will depend in part on the implications of new tariff trade and regulatory frameworks that now govern the provision of crossborder goods and services between the youk and the eea as well as the financial and operational consequences of the requirement for paypal europe to obtain new youk authorizations to operate its business longerterm within the youk market for additional information on how brexit could affect our business see 8220item 1a risk factors8212brexit the

financial statements included in this form 10k for additional information not meaningful net revenues increased 21 billion or 8 in 2022 compared to 2021 driven primarily by growth in total payment volume 8220tpv8221 as defined below under 8220key metrics8221 of 9 total operating expenses increased 26 billion or 12 in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and to a lesser extent increases in transaction and credit losses technology and development expenses and restructuring and other charges partially offset by a decline in sales and marketing expenses operating income decreased 425 million or 10 in 2022 compared to 2021 due to growth in operating expenses exceeding growth in net revenues our operating margin was 14 and 17 in 2022 and 2021 respectively operating margin for 2022 was negatively impacted primarily by increases in transaction expense and transaction and credit losses net income decreased by 18 billion or 42 in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to the previously discussed decrease in operating income of 425 million higher expense of 308 million in other income expense net driven primarily by losses on strategic investments and an increase in income tax expense of 10 billion primarily related to lower benefits associated with stockbased compensation deductions and higher expense related to intragroup transfers of intellectual property impact of foreign currency exchange rates we have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results the strengthening or weakening of the united states 8220yous8221 dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the yous dollar in 2022 2021 and 2020 we generated approximately 43 46 and 49 of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the yous respectively because we generate substantial net revenues internationally we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the yous including those discussed under 8220item 1a risk factors8221 we calculate the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings 35 table of contents in the years ended december16031 2022 and 2021 the yearoveryear foreign currency exchange rate movements relative to the yous dollar had the following impact on our reported results year ended december 3120222021in millionsunfavorable favorable impact to net revenues exclusive of

income516069160 while we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure we also use foreign currency exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the underlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities160the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities additionally in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur key metrics and financial results key metrics tpv number of payment transactions active accounts and number of payment transactions per active account are key nonfinancial performance metrics 8220key metrics8221 that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers and are defined as follows 8226tpv is the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 8226number of payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 8226an active account is an account registered directly with paypal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform not including gatewayexclusive transactions within the past 12 months a platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to paypal8217s platform or services through such thirdparty8217s login credentials including individuals and entities that utilize hyperwallet8217s payout capabilities a user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product accordingly a user may have more than one active account the number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results 36 table of contents 8226number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12month period divided by active accounts at the end of the period the number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period the number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account as our transaction revenue is typically correlated with tpv growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform the engagement level of our customers and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of current and future performance we present these key metrics to enhance investors8217 evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations while the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale the methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment we regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics for example we continuously apply models processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms and work to improve and enhance those capabilities when we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material net revenues our revenues are classified into the following two categories 8226transaction revenues net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the tpv completed on our payments platform growth in tpv is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform we earn additional fees from merchants and consumers on transactions where we perform currency conversion when we enable crossborder transactions ie transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their paypal or venmo account to their bank account or debit card to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms for example through fraud or counterfeiting and other miscellaneous fees 8226revenues from other value added services net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships referral fees subscription fees gateway fees and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers we also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances our revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors including the following 160 8226the mix of merchants products and services 8226the mix between domestic and crossborder transactions 8226the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs and 8226the amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers refer to 8220part i item 1a risk factors8221 in this form 10k for further discussion on factors that may impact our revenue 37 table of contents net revenue analysis the components of our net revenues for the years ended december16031 2022 2021 and 2020 were as follows in millions transaction revenues transaction revenues grew by 18 billion or 8 in 2022 compared to 2021 driven primarily by growth in our unbranded card processing volume which consists primarily of our braintree products and services and to a lesser extent venmo products and services in each case driven by growth in tpv and the number of payment transactions on our payments platform this growth in transaction revenues was partially offset by a decline in tpv and revenue generated from our core paypal products and services including foreign currency exchange fees revenue due primarily to a decrease in revenue earned on ebay8217s marketplace platform additionally for the year ended december16031 2022 transaction revenues included 190 million in contractual compensation from sellers that violated our contractual terms compared to 82 million in the year ended december16031 2021 this contractual compensation and the yearoveryear increase are predominantly attributable to activity in international markets the graphs below present the respective key metrics in millions for the years ended december 31 2022 2021 and 2020 reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period active accounts as of december16031 2021 include 32 million active accounts contributed by paidy inc 8220paidy8221 on the date of acquisition in october 2021 the following table provides a summary of related metrics 160year ended

we had active accounts of 435 million and 426 million as of december16031 2022 and 2021 respectively an increase of 2 number of payment transactions was 223 billion and 193 billion as of december16031 2022 and 2021 respectively an increase of 16 tpv was 136 trillion and 125 trillion as of december16031 2022 and 2021 respectively an increase of 9 38 table of contents transaction revenues grew more slowly than tpv and the number of payment transactions in 2022 due primarily to declines in foreign currency exchange fees tpv attributable to ebay8217s marketplace where we had historically earned higher rates and a decline in revenues from core paypal products and services partially offset by a favorable impact from hedging and an increase in revenue from our venmo products and services revenues from other value added services revenues from other value added services increased by 343 million or 17 in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from higher interest rates our revenue share earned from an independent chartered financial institution 8220partner institution8221 and interest and fee revenue on our merchant loans receivable portfolio growth in revenues from other value added services in the current period was partially offset by the impact of revenue earned from the servicing of loans facilitated under the yous government8217s paycheck protection program in 2021 of 157 million for which revenue was de minimis in the current period consumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to the partner institution may experience hardships that result in losses recognized by the partner institution which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned in future periods in the event the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs funded by the partner institution does not meet a minimum rate of return 8220minimum return threshold8221 in a particular quarter our revenue share for that period would be zero further in the event the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs managed by the partner institution does not meet the minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following quarter we would be required to make a payment to the partner institution subject to certain limitations through december16031 2022 the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs funded by the partner institution exceeded the minimum return threshold seasonality the company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues no individual quarter in 2022 2021 or 2020 accounted for more than 30 of annual net revenue operating expenses the following table summarizes our

financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer8217s credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet we refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our 8220funding mix8221 the cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a paypal or venmo account balance or our consumer credit products as we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers our funding mix may change which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate the cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs as we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit or debit cards outside the yous our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix merchant mix regional mix funding mix and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions macroeconomic environment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use which could also impact the funding mix transaction expense increased by 19 billion or 18 in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in tpv of 9 and unfavorable changes in product mix the increase in transaction expense rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was also attributable to unfavorable changes in product mix with a higher proportion of tpv from unbranded card processing volume which generally has higher expense rates than other products and services for the years ended december16031 2022 2021 and 2020 approximately 35 39 and 40 of tpv respectively was generated

the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants estimating our

the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 8226purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for cloud computing services advertising and capital expenditures and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business 8226operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our noncancelable operating leases including leases not yet commenced primarily for office and data center facilities the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 8226transition tax represents the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the tax act 8226longterm debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments based on contractual interest rates on our fixedrate debt for more information see 8220note160128212debt8221 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits net the table above does not include 19 billion of such noncurrent liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december16031 2022 other considerations our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating our financial performance and global credit market conditions as well as a broad range of other factors in addition our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see 8220item 1a risk factors8221 and 8220note 138212commitments and contingencies8221 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces 50 table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the application of yous generally accepted accounting principles 8220gaap8221 requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both a160the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b160the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in 8220note 18212overview and summary of significant accounting policies8221 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 108209k a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional because and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management8217s predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and such estimates require regular review and adjustment allowance for transaction and credit losses transaction and credit losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud chargebacks and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors including total tpv product mix current and projected macroeconomic conditions merchant insolvency events changes to and usage of our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products which include revolving and installment credit products offered to consumers at checkout and merchant loans and advances arising from the paypal working capital and paypal business loan products we establish allowances for negative customer balances and estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchantrelated chargebacks due to nondelivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items purchase protection program claims account takeovers and automated clearing house returns additions to the allowance in the form of provisions are reflected in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income loss the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances internal factors including experience with similar cases historical trends involving collection and writeoff patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types as well as current and projected macroeconomic factors as appropriate we also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the allowance is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio the loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region first borrowing versus repeat borrowing delinquency loan term internally developed risk ratings credit rating and vintage which vary by portfolio the loss models also incorporate macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment retail ecommerce sales and household disposable income and through the second quarter of 2022 benchmark credit card chargeoff rates which are sourced externally using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period projected loss rates inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors are applied to the principal amount of our merchant and consumer receivables our consumer receivables consist of revolving products which do not have a contractual term and installment products the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products installment products and merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates for 2022 which approximates the estimated life of the loans is approximately 2 years approximately 7 months to 35 years and approximately 25 to 35 years respectively in 2021 the reasonable and supportable forecast periods were consistent with 2022 except for installment products which had an estimated life of 7 months to 25 years we also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses the allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography delinquency and period of origination among other factors 51 table of contents determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit losses at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts as of december16031 2022 we utilized externally published projections of the yous and youk forecasted unemployment rates forecasted yous retail ecommerce sales and forecasted youk household disposable income among others over the reasonable and supportable forecast period as of december16031 2021 we utilized externally published projections of the yous and youk forecasted unemployment rates over the reasonable and supportable forecast period the overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of december16031 2022 and 2021 was approximately 7 and 9 respectively a significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factors could result in a material change in our allowances our allowance as of december16031 2022 took into account uncertainty with respect to macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty around the financial health of our borrowers and effectiveness of loan modification programs made available to merchants our allowance as of december16031 2021 took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers including uncertainty around the effectiveness of loan modification programs made available to merchants an increase of 1 in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately 80 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of december16031 2022 accounting for income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the yous through provisions such as the gilti tax and base erosion antiabuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management8217s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors including our historical experience and shortrange and longrange business forecasts to the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized we record a valuation allowance we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with yous gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return yous gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest and penalties where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash based on our results for the year ended december16031 2022 a onepercentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 34 million 52 table of contents loss contingencies we are currently involved in various claims regulatory and legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims litigation or other violations and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may differ materially from the actual outcomes revenue recognition application of the accounting principles in yous gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer or consideration payable on behalf of a customer requires judgment incentives determined to be made to a customer or payable on behalf of a customer are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized valuation of goodwill and intangibles the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management8217s assumptions which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur evaluation of strategic investments for impairment we have strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities which include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and are measured at cost minus impairment if any and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer the measurement alternative we review these investments regularly to determine if impairment has occurred we assess whether an impairment loss on these nonmarketable equity securities which are primarily investments in privately held companies has occurred based on qualitative factors such as the companies8217 financial condition and business outlook industry performance regulatory economic or technological environment and other relevant events and factors affecting the company when indicators of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of these nonmarketable equity securities using the market approach andor the income approach if any impairment is identified we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income loss estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates forecasted cash flows and market data of comparable companies among others'"
